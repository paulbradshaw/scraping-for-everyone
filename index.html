  <title>Scraping for Everyone: example webpages
  </title>

<h1>Sample pages for the book Scraping for Everyone</h1>
<p>
In the book <em>Scraping for Everyone</em> (first published as <a href="https://leanpub.com/scrapingforjournalists/"><em>Scraping for Journalists</em></a>) I use a number of examples of live webpages that you can use scraping techniques with.
</p>
<p>
Over time, many of these webpages may either change their design or their structure, or disappear altogether, which means that the code explained in the book will no longer work.
</p>
<p>
If that happens, you can use the samples listed below to test that code and see it working. Note that I have only used the raw HTML, so these webpages do not include any images or other resources. However, the scrapers are only concerned with that raw HTML.
