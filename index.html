<h1>Sample pages for the book Scraping for Everyone</h1>

In the book <em>Scraping for Everyone</em> (also published as <em>Scraping for Journalists</em>) I use a number of examples of live webpages that you can use scraping techniques with.

Over time, many of these webpages may either change their design or their structure, or disappear altogether, which means that the code explained in the book will no longer work.

If that happens, you can use the samples listed below to test that code and see it working. Note that I have only used the raw HTML, so these webpages do not include any images or other resources. However, the scrapers are only concerned with that raw HTML.

<h2>Chapter 6: Structure in URLs</h2>

You can find copies of the webpages mentioned in the site here:

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="hospitalresults.htm">Hospital search results page</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="hospitalpage.htm">Hospital detail page</a>
</li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>
