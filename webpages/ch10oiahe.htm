    <a href="#" class="accordianTitle2">Case Study 77<span class="accordianTitle3"><br />Issues: Three year deadline<br />Outcome: <strong>Settled</strong></span></a>
  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S complained that the University had misled him regarding module options. As a result, S had to study an additional module, paying a further module fee, following the completion of his course in order to achieve upper second class honours in a subject specific qualification.</p>
<p>The University did not have complete records of the advice given to S regarding module choices, including the advice for the module that was key to the decision not to award the higher classification.</p>
<p>S only found out about the issue of complaint shortly before the complaint was made when he was told that the module choices had caused them to be ineligible for a subject specific upper second class honours degree.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The OIA decided although the events took place over three years ago, our usual period for excluding complaints due to the age of the issues.</p>
<p>The OIA suggested to the University that, in the light of the lack of records revising advice available to S, a reasonable resolution of the complaint would be to offer S the remedy he was seeking, namely a waiver of the module fee.</p>
<p>The University accepted the OIA's suggestion and the complaint was resolved on this basis. The University was pleased to resolve the complaint amicably by making this offer to S.</p></div>

    <a href="#" class="accordianTitle2">Case Study 76<span class="accordianTitle3"><br />Issues: Fitness to Practise, Hearings<br />Outcome: <strong>Justified</strong></span></a>
  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was registered for a Nursing Diploma. During S's studies the local Social Services contacted the University raising concerns over S's fitness to practise due to a matter they were considering relating to S's personal life. The University considered the concerns under its fitness to practise procedure and consequently withdrew S from his studies on grounds of fitness to practise.</p>
<p>S complained that the University had not followed its procedure in considering his fitness to practise, that the process was subject to potential bias, that S was not allowed to attend and present his case to a fitness to practise hearing and that the decision made was unreasonable as it was not supported by the available evidence and was made based on assumptions, nor did it consider the mitigating factors S had presented in writing.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The OIA considered that the University had followed its fitness to practise procedure correctly save in one respect: it failed to add new members to the Appeal Panel.</p>
<p>However, the University's procedure did not require it to hold a hearing which the student could attend in determining issues of fitness to practise. The OIA considered that this process was not fair and reasonable. S should have been able to attend a hearing before his fitness to practise was determined given the seriousness of the allegation and the importance of the decision. Furthermore, S disputed the allegations, which had not been proven in previous disciplinary or legal proceedings. It was not sufficient to allow the student to make a written submission in these circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<p>The OIA recommended that the University offer to convene a fresh Panel with no prior knowledge of the matter to assess S's fitness to practise. Our recommendation required the University to offer to hold a hearing which S could attend to determine his fitness to practise. We also recommended the University offer to compensate S £500 for the distress caused to him by the procedural unfairness we had identified. It was not appropriate to award a higher sum because the outcome of the second fitness to practise panel was far from certain.</p>
<p>The OIA also recommended the University review its fitness to practise procedure to ensure students are offered a hearing where the specific allegations giving rise to the fitness to practise proceedings have not been admitted by the student, or conclusively established, for example through disciplinary proceedings involving a hearing, or criminal proceedings.</p></div>

    <a href="#" class="accordianTitle2">Case Study 75<span class="accordianTitle3"><br />Issues: Extenuating Circumstances<br />Outcome: <strong>Not Justified</strong></span></a>
  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was terminated from her course after repeatedly failing assessments. After receiving her results she appealed this decision on the grounds that her performance had been affected by difficulties in her personal life.</p>
<p>The University's regulations stated that if a student appealed their marks on the grounds that their performance had been affected by extenuating circumstances, they had to demonstrate a valid and over-riding reason why they had failed to engage with the University's extenuating circumstances procedures at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>S stated that she had not disclosed these matters to the University previously due to embarrassment, concerns about the University's ability to maintain confidentiality, and because her mental health prevented her from understanding that she should engage with the University's procedures.</p>
<p>The University rejected S's appeal and S brought a complaint to the OIA.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The OIA determined that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Universities normally do not accept embarrassment as a reason for failing to disclose extenuating circumstances and we consider this to be reasonable. In this case, the University had advertised a number of ways in which a student could limit staff knowledge of their circumstances while still having them considered – but there was no evidence that suggested that the student had made any enquiries about the matter at the time.</li>
<li>S submitted anonymous, unsubstantiated, claims about the actions of an unnamed lecturer with respect to that lecturer's alleged breaches of confidentiality a number of months previously. No details were provided which might have allowed the University to investigate the claims, nor was any complaint made at the time of the alleged breaches. The student had not previously made any enquiries to discover who would have access to the details of claims of extenuating circumstances. The University did not accept S's claims to be sufficient to over-ride her responsibility to engage with its extenuating circumstances procedures, and we considered this to be reasonable.</li>
<li>S claimed that her mental health had prevented her from thinking clearly and understanding that she should engage with the University's extenuating circumstances procedures. The OIA considered it reasonable for the University to expect the student to provide independent evidence from a medical professional to confirm her claims, but S failed to provide such evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OIA considered that it was reasonable for the University to conclude that the student did not demonstrate a valid and over-riding reason why she had failed to engage with the University's extenuating circumstances procedures at the appropriate time and therefore it was reasonable for the University to reject her appeal.</p></div>

    <a href="#" class="accordianTitle2">Case Study 74<span class="accordianTitle3"><br />Issues: Academic Appeal; Eligibility Appeal<br />Outcome: <strong>Eligible</strong></span></a>
  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was studying a Medicine and Surgery undergraduate course. She failed a final year clinical examination and complained that extenuating circumstances had not been fully taken into account.</p>
<p>The university regulations allow students to submit an Academic Appeal, an Academic Complaint or both in relation to academic concerns. S pursued both routes.</p>
<p>The university dealt with the academic aspects of S's appeal within the Academic Appeal process and referred a subset of issues to the university complaints procedure. The same documentation was used for both processes. The university issued separate Completion of Procedures letters at the end of each process.</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>S submitted her complaint to the OIA three months and nine days after issue of the earlier Completion of Procedures letter, covering the Academic Appeal. S argued that since the Academic Appeal and the Academic Complaint were related it was reasonable to wait for the completion of both processes before making a submission.</p>
<p>The OIA considered that the complaint was ineligible under the rules of the scheme because the Complaint Form was received late. S appealed to a member of the Approval Team.</p>
<p>The Approver ruled that, in the circumstances of this case, there was good reason to allow an extension of the three month deadline, under Rule 4.2 of the scheme.</p>
<p>In this case the issues raised in the Academic Appeal and Complaint were so closely related that it was reasonable for S to assume that the university internal processes were complete only when both processes had come to an end.</p></div>

    <a href="#" class="accordianTitle2">Case Study 73<span class="accordianTitle3"><br />Issues: Theft; Rule 3.5: Not affecting the complainant as a student<br />Outcome: <strong>Not Eligible</strong></span></a>
  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was registered on a Foundation degree in Business and Management.</p>
<p>His bicycle was lost from a cycle rack outside the University library. S's representative complained to the University which did not accept liability for the loss, and asked for proof that the bicycle had been stolen. He complained further about communications received from the University, which the representative interpreted as implying that the University did not believe S's claim that his bicycle had been stolen.</p>
<p>S believed that his performance was affected by the stress of losing his bicycle and by the fact that this increased his journey time.</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The OIA considered that the complaint was ineligible under Rule 3.5 of the Scheme because the matter complained about did not materially affect the complainant as a student. The substance of S's complaint concerned the way in which the University had responded to the theft of the bicycle and did not relate to his experiences as a student.</p>
<p>S had the opportunity under the University's regulations to submit a claim for extenuating circumstances if he felt that his academic performance was affected by the loss of the bicycle, but did not do so.</p>
<p>The University regulations made it clear that the University cannot accept responsibility for bicycles that are left on University premises.</p>
<p>S's representative appealed to a member of the Approval Team, and the decision was upheld.</p></div>

    <a href="#" class="accordianTitle2">Case Study 72<span class="accordianTitle3"><br />Issues: Service Issues; Group Complaint<br />Outcome: <strong>Settled/Justified</strong></span></a>
  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>In the final year of a course, the course leader went on long term sick leave and eventually did not return to the university. The cohort was dissatisfied with the course delivery and a meeting was held with staff and student representatives. The cohort submitted a group complaint to the Department. One of the cohort, the Complaint Representative, met with the Head of Department and the Dean to discuss the complaints. The Department also responded in writing setting out the steps taken to address the situation. A number of the cohort remained dissatisfied and escalated their complaint to the University. The  University decided that  all reasonable steps had been taken to  minimise the impact on the student experience and that the level of  support was appropriate. The  University said it had engaged replacement teachers, provided  additional classes, assigned staff to produce handbooks when it became  aware of the handbook deficiencies and that the quality issues in  relation to one module had been referred to a wider review by the  Department. The  University therefore deferred consideration of a request for  compensation for that aspect until the wider review was complete. However, no compensation was offered to the group.</p>
<p>Seven  of the cohort submitted a group complaint to the OIA about inadequate  equipment, lack of feedback, lack of advertised modules, tight deadlines  for assessments due to staffing issues, incomplete handbooks,  inadequate steps taken to address staff absences, reduced contact time  with replacement staff, delayed start to a module which impacted on  later assessments.</p>
<p>At  the start of the OIA's review, one member of the cohort settled their  complaint with the University on the basis of an ex gratia payment of  £500. The OIA continued its review into the complaints of the remaining six complainants. In  its representations to the OIA, the University said that the course had  been withdrawn and the course staff were no longer employed by the  University but that the terms agreed with the departing staff prevented  the University from providing further details to the OIA. The University said that the issues leading to the staff departures related to the issues raised in the group complaint.</p>
<p><span><span><strong>Reasons:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It appeared that the University provided limited information due to the confidentiality restrictions with exiting staff. Consequently,  the OIA was not persuaded that the University had shown it had properly  investigated the complaint or how it determined that all reasonable  steps were taken to minimise the impact on the student experience. The  OIA considered that the provision of services fell short of that  promised and would have impacted on the student experience. The  OIA emphasised that it had not commented on the University's academic  judgment that the replacement services were of a suitable standard.</span></span><span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Recommendations:</strong></span><br /> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>The University should offer each of  the remaining group members the sum of £1,500 for the disappointment,  distress and inconvenience experienced in relation to the service  provided by the University - this falls within Level C of the distress  and inconvenience awards in the OIA's approach to <a href="/web/20150423163307/http://www.oiahe.org.uk/media/42902/oia_remedies_and_redress_leaflet.pdf">remedies and redress</a>.</li>

    <a href="#" class="accordianTitle2">Case Study 71<span class="accordianTitle3"><br />Issues: Coursework submission<br />Outcome: <strong>Justified</strong></span></a>
  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S's mark for two pieces of coursework was capped at 40% on the basis that it had been submitted late. S disputed that the deadline of 14:00 had passed at the time she, and two other students attempted to enter the hand-in room. S stated that she and the other affected students were at the back of a group who all arrived at the room at the same time. The front half were able to enter the room, but due to space limitation she could not. The door to the room was then closed and as the students preceding her were allowed to leave the room, S was informed that she would need to place her work into the late submission box, completing an extenuating circumstances form if necessary.</p>
<p>S submitted a complaint, which was rejected. She was advised of the availability of a stage three submission on limited grounds, and alternatively the availability of the academic appeal process. S submitted an academic appeal on the grounds of a material and significant administrative error or other material irregularity in the conduct of an assessment. Her appeal submission included a statement from a student already in the hand-in room at the time, stating that S was shut out of the room prior to 14:00. The University rejected the appeal on the basis that a radio-controlled clock was used by staff to determine the time, and further that staff had been told to allow any student approaching the room at the deadline to enter. The Completion of Procedures Letter also stated that two members of staff had provided statements to the effect that the door was not closed early.</p>
<p>S made a complaint to the OIA.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>Statements from members of staff submitted by the University were post-dated, and the two statements taken at the time were unavailable.</p>
<p>Whilst the University had highlighted guidance given to staff regarding students approaching the hand-in room at the time of the deadline, this did not constitute evidence that the guidance was followed in this particular case. Therefore, neither party could provide indisputable evidence as to what occurred and the most suitable forum to test the reliability of the evidence available would have been an appeal hearing.</p>
<p>The penalty was harsh in light of the lack of appeal hearing.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:<br /></strong><span> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>University      to reconsider S's profile with the marks for the two modules uncapped.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>University      to advise the OIA whether this could be achieved by Chair of Examination      Board action, at the next Examination Board meeting or by another      mechanism.</li>

    <a href="#" class="accordianTitle2">Case Study 70<span class="accordianTitle3"><br />Issues: Academic Misconduct<br />Outcome: <strong>Justified</strong></span></a>
  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was found guilty of academic misconduct following an anonymous 'tip-off' to the University that S had purchased/commissioned a piece of work. S had already received an award from the University and, in addition to a penalty, the Panel recommended that the award should be revoked. It also recommended that S's conduct should be investigated under the University's Fitness to Practise regulations.</p>
<p>S appealed against the panel's decision and attended an Academic Misconduct Review Panel which rejected her appeal. S subsequently withdrew from the university before the completion of the Fitness to Practise investigation.</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA that the decision of the Panel was unsupported by the evidence, that a procedural irregularity had prejudiced her case and that additional evidence had come to light which could not have been produced at the time the case was considered.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The Chair of the Academic Misconduct Review Panel had been involved with the early stages of the academic misconduct investigation, had provided advice about how best to proceed and had reviewed the case and the evidence available. A further member of the Panel had been also involved at the informal stages of the academic misconduct investigation.</p>
<p>The OIA concluded that the University had failed to follow the principles of natural justice (duty to act fairly) which, amongst other things, provides that hearing panels must come to the matter afresh and should not have been involved in the investigation leading up to the hearing or in making earlier decisions. The issue is not whether the panel was actually biased but whether there was a perception of bias. It was therefore unreasonable for the university to reject S's appeal on this basis.</p>
<p><span><strong>Recommendations:<br /></strong><span> </span></span></p>
<div style="text-indent: 0px;">
<ul>
<li>As S had since withdrawn, it was recommended that the University offer her the sum of £1,500 for the distress and inconvenience caused by the University's omission –  <span>this falls within Level C of the distress and inconvenience awards in </span><span><a href="/web/20150423163307/http://www.oiahe.org.uk/media/42902/oia_remedies_and_redress_leaflet.pdf">the OIA's approach to remedies and redress</a></span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>The OIA <span><span>suggested</span></span><span> that</span> the University take steps to ensure the independence and impartiality of those involved in the academic misconduct process by amending the Academic Misconduct Regulations to ensure that hearing panels at all stages of the procedure are constituted of those with no previous involvement with the matter. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>The OIA also reminded the University that its procedure stated that students accused of academic misconduct shall be considered innocent until judged to be guilty.</span></li>

    <a href="#" class="accordianTitle2">Case Study 69<span class="accordianTitle3"><br />Issues: Supervision; Complaints Procedure<br />Outcome: <strong>Partly Justified</strong></span></a>
  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<p>S made an appeal to the University when he was dissatisfied with the marks awarded for his final year project. S alleged that the University had failed to provide adequate supervision for his project, failed to mark his project in the manner agreed, and failed to award marks appropriately in light of the marking criteria.</p>
<p>The University dismissed the appeal, stating that it should have been brought under the complaints procedures, and that none of the issues raised were valid grounds of appeal.</p>
<p>S submitted a Complaint Form to the OIA.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The OIA considered that while the University acted reasonably in dismissing some elements of the appeal, the dispute over the process used to mark S's work was a matter which should be considered under the University's appeal procedures, and that S had presented a valid ground of appeal.</p>
<p><strong><span>Recommendations:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The University consider S's      appeal at a hearing to which the student should be invited to attend.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The OIA made no comments as      to the merits of the appeal.</li>

    <a href="#" class="accordianTitle2">Case Study 68<span class="accordianTitle3"><br />Issues: Academic Appeal; Mitigating Circumstances<br />Outcome: <strong>Partly Justified</strong></span></a>
  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>S complained about the University's decision to dismiss her appeal against the Board's decision that she had failed reassessment of a module and to award her a Certificate of Higher Education.</p>
<p>In her appeal S cited mitigating circumstances affecting her assessment performance, including her father's ill-health, her hay-fever and an injury to her foot, as well as the disruption caused during the examination by individuals entering and leaving the examination room.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The University's Appeal Regulations state that an appeal will normally be rejected if it appears that the student was subject to a disturbance or illness during an examination and there is no valid reason for it not to have been brought to the attention of the Assessment Board before it met. It was therefore reasonable for the University not to uphold this aspect of the appeal.</p>
<p>S did not provide evidence of her father's ill-health with her appeal application and she did not provide evidence to demonstrate how these circumstances affected her or her assessment performance at the time. As such, it was reasonable for the University not to uphold this part of the appeal.</p>
<p>The medical note relating to S's foot injury did not explicitly cover the relevant date of assessment. However the doctor's letter did state that S was suffering from severe hay-fever (affecting her concentration) and that she was on medication for her foot injury and for hay-fever. The letter also states that "this will certainly affect her performance for her study and work". The University's decision was that the evidence did not state that S was unfit to sit the examination.</p>
<p>The OIA found that in making this decision the University was setting a threshold for extenuating circumstances that was not reflected in the appeal regulations. Appeals will normally be rejected if there is no evidence to support an application that academic performance was adversely affected by factors such as ill health. The OIA was unable to identify any requirement for students to demonstrate that their performance was affected to the point that they were unable to take the examination.</p>
<p><strong><span>Recommendations:<br /></span></strong><span> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The University should offer to reconsider the appeal. This reconsideration may be limited to the extenuating circumstances concerning S's ill health (hay-fever and foot injury).</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On completion of S's appeal she should be issued with a new Completion of Procedures Letter and will have the same recourse to the OIA if she remains unhappy with the University's final decision.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>The reconsideration of the appeal should be concluded within 35 days of our Formal Decision.</span></li>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was found guilty of plagiarism following a plagiarism panel hearing.</p>
<p>S submitted a complaint to the University saying that its plagiarism guidance was unclear.  S also complained that plagiarism issues with her work were not picked up earlier and that a 'tick box' about referencing was not enough to enable a student to pick up errors in their work. The University rejected her complaint.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The  University provided a copy of the programme handbook which set out the  University's guidance on plagiarism which students were expected to  familiarise themselves with.  The University was also able to show that students were given further guidance on plagiarism during taught sessions although it transpired that S had not attended those sessions. In addition, S had signed a declaration confirming that she had read and understood the University's regulations relating to plagiarism when submitting her work.</p>
<p>The OIA considered that, if S required further guidance beyond that provided, she should have sought this at the time. It was also noted that S had not raised any issues with regard to plagiarism guidance before the outcome of the plagiarism panel hearing was known.</p></div>

    <a href="#" class="accordianTitle2">Case Study 66<span class="accordianTitle3"><br />Issues: Plagiarism; Academic Misconduct<br />Outcome: <strong>Not Justified</strong></span></a>
  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><span><span><strong>Summary:</strong></span><br /> </span></p>
<div></div>
<p><span>S was registered on an MRes, a twelve month programme for which over half the credits come from independent written work (two long essays). S submitted the second written piece and the University identified a high level of plagiarism in this essay, through an academic's assessment, followed by an evaluation using Turnitin plagiarism software. The alleged plagiarism was then evaluated further by academics in accordance with the University's academic conduct procedure. </span></p>
<p><span>S was given all the available documentation along with the University's case regarding the alleged plagiarism and was invited to a sub-committee to discuss the allegations. S said he had other appointments and could not attend this meeting. The sub-committee met and decided unanimously that there was a very high level of plagiarism in the work and awarded a mark of zero for the essay as a penalty. This decision was then sent to the Board of Examiners for it to determine S's exit award. The Board of Examiners determined that S could not be awarded the MRes, as there was no right of resubmission once the second essay was deemed a fail, and under the award regulations a student has to achieve 90% of the available credits to obtain the degree.</span></p>
<p><span>S appealed against both the decision of the sub-committee as to the plagiarism and the decision of the Board of Examiners as to the exit award. S said that he wished to submit fresh evidence to show that the plagiarism was a technical glitch. The University rejected both appeals.</span></p>
<p><span>S submitted his OIA Complaint Form along with two Completion of Procedures Letters concerning the two unsuccessful appeals. He also submitted a plagiarism report on the second essay which he had obtained through a different software system from Turnitin. S said that he believed his case did not warrant such a drastic decision, as this second plagiarism report indicated there was a minimal amount of plagiarism in the essay.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>Reasons:</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The OIA found that S's appeals did not meet the criteria for a successful appeal under the University's Regulations and that the two decisions were fair and reasonable in the circumstances. We also found that the penalty of a mark of zero for the affected essay was within the range of penalties available to the academic misconduct sub-committee.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The OIA considered that in light of the seriousness of the consequences of a finding of plagiarism S should have considered asking for the sub-committee hearing to be postponed, so that he could attend, or that he could have considered changing his other appointment so that he could attend the plagiarism hearing. There was no evidence that S attempted to take either step.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In relation to the question of whether Turnitin was the appropriate software for testing plagiarism in this case, we considered that as Turnitin is recommended by JISC (the recognised UK expert on information and digital technologies in the HE sector) that the University was following good practice in the sector by using this particular detection tool.  In view of the need for Turnitin reports to be interpreted by someone with the appropriate expertise, we noted that in  this case an academic had already detected plagiarism before the Turnitin  originality report was run and that qualified staff subsequently  interpreted the report.</span></span></span></p></div>

    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S made an appeal against her final examination results and received an email from the University which advised her that she had the right of appeal against the decision of the Grievance Panel and Board of Examiners. S understood that this email was a Completion of Procedures Letter.</p>
<p>S submitted an OIA Complaint Form which the OIA found Not Eligible under Rule 4.1 which states that the 'OIA will only accept a complaint which has not exhausted the internal procedures of the University or College for review if there are exceptional reasons to do so'. The OIA found that S had not completed the internal procedures of the University.</p>
<p>S appealed the decision of the case-handler to the Approval Team.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The member of the Approval Team allowed the appeal. She found that although the email S received included a copy of the procedure, and an explicit mention of the relevant paragraphs, it was also headed 'Final Completion of Procedures'.</p>
<p>The OIA concluded it was not unreasonable for S to understand this to mean that the University intended the email to function as a Completion of Procedures Letter, should she choose to approach the OIA rather than engage with the final stage of the procedure.</p>
<p>The OIA also noted that a previous email sent to S was similarly headed 'Completion of Procedures', and that it was referred to as 'a Completion of Procedures email.'</p>
<p>In deciding to exercise its discretion to accept this complaint the OIA also had regard to S's submissions which indicated that she was not provided with a copy of the Board of Examiners' minutes, or any report that it had given to the Grievance Panel before the deadline for submitting an appeal expired. The OIA considered that without this information, it might have been difficult for S to make an informed decision as to whether it was appropriate to submit an appeal and the grounds which she might use.</p>
<p>The complaint was reallocated to a new case-handler.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The OIA suggested that the University should consider whether its communications to students under this procedure might be misleading.</li>

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was enrolled on an Overseas Trained Teacher (OTT) programme delivered by a consortium of institutions. The consortium included 2 qualifying universities, one non-qualifying teaching institution, and four local councils. One of the qualifying universities took on the lead role in delivering the teaching programmes, and the OTT was one of three programmes delivered by the consortium.</p>
<p>S's studies were terminated due to the assessment of one of his placements. S registered an appeal, based on the standard of his supervision and bias in the assessment process. This appeal was handled and reviewed by the lead university in the consortium.</p>
<p>S submitted a Complaint Form to the OIA.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>Upon reviewing the consortium's Memorandum of Cooperation, it became apparent that OTT students were not formally registered at either of the qualifying universities. The OIA also asked the lead university for some of the course literature and an example of the certificates issued to successful participants, which showed that the award came directly from the General Teaching Council, and not from the university itself.</p>
<p>This complaint was therefore ruled ineligible under Rule 2 of the <a href="/web/20150423163307/http://www.oiahe.org.uk/media/1258/oia-rules-march-2013.pdf">OIA's Rules</a>, whereby the OIA can only accept complaints from students at a qualifying institution, or students on programmes leading to an award from that university.</p></div>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was a student on a Diploma in HE Nursing Studies programme, who submitted a complaint to the OIA in October 2011.</p>
<p>The complaint related to a lack of support  offered to her. S had been advised by Occupational Health that she  required additional support for her nursing course in 2007, and was seen  by an Occupational Health doctor in February 2008. She had undertaken  two placements without, what the student considered, the basic support  being in place, let alone the additional support required. This impacted  on her mental health, causing her to become depressed and suicidal.  Occupational Health withdrew its support to her working. The student  sought professional help and interrupted her studies, eventually  withdrawing.</p>
<p>S instigated a complaint through the University's  procedures in June 2008, which had been escalated in November 2008.  Since then no further correspondence had been received from the  University and no Completion of Procedures Letter was issued.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong><br /><br /> The University replied to the case-handler's  enquiries at the initial assessment stage regarding the status of the  complaint. The University recognised that the complaint had been  inadequately dealt with, and had been overlooked due to administrative  errors.</p>
<p>It provided a limited response to the complaints,  but recognised that due to the passage of time it would be difficult to  make a meaningful reply. The University acknowledged the additional  distress caused by its failure to respond sooner to the complaint, and  made an offer of £4,000 to compensate S.</p>
<p><span><strong>Recommendations:</strong><br /></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The offer was accepted resolving the complaint within 6 weeks of receipt.</span></li>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was studying for a  PGCE. After ten months, he was identified as being 'at risk' in relation  to his performance on a placement. A Remediation Agreement was drawn up  which identified ways in which he needed to improve. Eight days later,  he failed a lesson observation. This subsequently resulted in a decision  that he should fail the placement, and therefore the degree.</p>
<p>S appealed on the  grounds that he had been diagnosed with an illness immediately after the  failed lesson observation. He said that he had been unable to attend a  further attempt which had been scheduled for the following day. He  supplied medical evidence confirming that he had been advised not to  attend the school.</p>
<p>The University  rejected the appeal on the grounds that (i) he had been deemed 'at  risk', (ii) the Faculty had deemed the information in his appeal to be  irrelevant, and (iii) he had not missed any assessment as a result of  illness, because no further opportunity had been offered to him.</p>
<p>S provided the OIA  with documentary evidence that an offer of a further opportunity had  been made. The University accepted that the evidence was genuine;  however, it stated that even if S had passed the lesson observation, he  would have failed the placement anyway. It said that S had never been  told that the lesson observation would affect the final decision  regarding the placement.</p>
<p>The OIA did not  consider that the University's statement was consistent with the  evidence. The e-mail offering S a further lesson observation had  specifically said that if he passed it then a decision would be made  about whether he had passed the Remediation Agreement, and therefore  whether he could continue on placement. On that basis, the focus of the  OIA's review was widened to include a consideration of the remediation  process. Specifically, the OIA looked at whether the University had  followed its procedures and whether it had given accurate and clear  information to S.</p>
<p>The  handbook containing the remediation procedures contained two  contradictory accounts of the process to be followed. The University had  not followed either process. There was also evidence that if S had  passed the remediation process, staff intended to begin a new process  covering different issues. They had not informed S about those concerns,  or given him the opportunity to try to address them.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The OIA concluded that this complaint was Justified because:</p>
<ul>
<li>the University's decision about the appeal was based on inaccurate information; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>it was unreasonable to reject S's extenuating circumstances on the  grounds of his 'at risk' status, rather than the merits of the  circumstances themselves;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the procedures did not permit Faculty members to make decisions  regarding appeals. The Registry decision-maker accepted the Faculty's  opinion that the appeal was 'irrelevant' without any evidence or further  investigation;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the University had not followed its remediation procedure; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the University had given S unclear information about what he needed  to do in order to pass. It did not inform him of all its concerns, which  denied him the opportunity to address them. He was given an  unreasonable expectation that if he passed a further assessment  opportunity, he might pass the placement although the University says  that this was not its intention.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<p>The  OIA did not consider that it was appropriate to recommend that the  University should reconsider S's appeal. He had subsequently failed a  different module at final attempt and would not be able to graduate even  if he were to be given the opportunity to resit the placement. The OIA  recommended that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The  University should pay S £1000 compensation for inconvenience and  distress caused by its failure to explain its academic requirements to  him, and by its failure to properly consider his appeal. This amount  sits in the middle of the OIA's band C for "substantial" distress and  inconvenience. For more information on the indicative bands for distress  and inconvenience awards please see our OIA's <a href="/web/20150423163307/http://www.oiahe.org.uk/decisions-and-publications/leaflets.aspx" title="Leaflets">approach to Remedies and Redress</a> leaflet. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The  University should review its handbooks in order to ensure that  consistent and clear information regarding the remediation process is  available to students.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The  University should review the training given to staff in order to ensure  that they are aware of the need to inform PGCE students of any concerns  regarding their academic or professional standards.</li>

    <a href="#" class="accordianTitle2">Case Study 61<span class="accordianTitle3"><br />Issues: Extenuating Circumstances; Medical evidence not properly considered <br />Outcome: <strong>Justified</strong></span></a>
  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S  had a severe chest infection and was signed off University for two  weeks on 15 January which meant she would be unable to attend exams  taking place on 17 and 28 January. She submitted a claim for Extenuating  Circumstances but this was rejected as the evidence in support of her claim did not <em>"demonstrate the severity of [her] chest infection"</em>. S was informed that her exam retakes would be capped at 40%.</p>
<p>S  appealed on the grounds that the University had not properly considered  the medical evidence; that her illness was so severe that her doctor  had advised her that she was not well enough to sit her exam. The  medical certificate provided by her doctor was dated 12 days in advance  of the exams but did cover the dates on which she was due to take the  exams. S  appealed and provided another letter from her GP which confirmed her  condition but this was rejected as insufficient evidence as it did not  confirm the severity of her condition at the time the exams were to take  place and did not prove that she was examined by a doctor on, or  immediately around the time the exams took place. She  appealed again with another letter from her GP but this was also  rejected and she was told she had exhausted the University's procedures.</p>
<p>S made a complaint to the OIA.</p>
<p>The OIA found the complaint Justified.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong><br /><br /> It was not clear how S had not acted in  accordance with the regulations and the University had not provided  sufficient evidence as to how S had not complied. The  medical certificates were independent evidence that verified that S was  not in a fit state of health to attend her assessments. It  was not reasonable for the University to have expected her to attend  the doctor for a second time at the time of her exams when she already  had a medical certificate. Additionally, this two week period would undoubtedly have been an important study and preparation time.</p>
<p>Whilst  the University's view was that its decision was in line with its  procedures, the OIA did not consider that it had acted in a fair and  reasonable manner, nor did the OIA consider that the guidance issued  adequately explained situations where the medical certificate was  written in advance of the assessments. Furthermore,  the University was not in a position to question or discount the  professional medical opinion of the GP which was that S would not be fit  to sit the exams.</p>
<p><span><span><strong>Recommendations:</strong><br /></span> 
<ul>
<li><span>The University should reconsider S's appeal and remove any capping applied to any subsequent results achieved.</span></li>

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S received a mark of 49% (fail) for one of the  core modules for her MSc. S informed the Examination Sub Board about  mitigating circumstances, with evidence. The Examination Sub Board met  in November, accepted the mitigating circumstances and raised the  student's mark to 50% (pass). In the following July the Examination  Board met and noted that the University's regulations did not permit  marks to be adjusted in this way and reversed the decision, returning  the student's mark to 49% (fail). S was not informed of this until  October, which was after the re-sit period and during S's final  preparation of her dissertation; as such it was not viable to provide  her with an additional re-sit opportunity.</p>
<p>S complained about the reversal decision by the  Examination Board and the delay in informing her. She requested that her  mark be re-adjusted to 50%. She also stated that she felt disability  discrimination had occurred as the University had not considered her  underlying mental health issues before deciding to reverse the decision  and in failing to communicate it to her in a satisfactory way.</p>
<p>The University upheld the student's complaint on  the grounds that a procedural error had occurred, although it did not  address the question of S's disability. The University guaranteed the  student a condoned fail in this module, provided she passed the final  dissertation, but would not adjust the mark back up to a pass as it was  against the regulations. S was dissatisfied with the outcome and made a  complaint to the OIA.</p>
<p>The OIA found the complaint Partly Justified.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong><br /><br /> After reviewing the case, the OIA concluded that  the University was right not to re-raise S's marks as there was no  provision to do so in the regulations. There was also no evidence to  suggest that the University had acted unreasonably towards S on the  basis of her disability. However the OIA felt that the remedy proposed  by the University could be improved.</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Recommendations:</span></strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>S to be  provided with a letter accompanying her transcript which explained that  she had been deprived of the opportunity to retrieve her failure in this  module due to a procedural error in the University's assessment  process.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>The  University should issue a formal apology for the errors made in the  assessment process and the distress and inconvenience caused, and that  the apology be issued by an appropriate member of the senior management  team. (This did not amount to an admission of liability for the impact  on S's mental health.)</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>S to be  awarded £750 compensation for distress and inconvenience, which took  into account the fact that the inadequate communication during the  assessment process was compounded by her underlying mental health  disability. This amount sits at the</span> <span>upper  limit of the OIA's band B for distress and inconvenience.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>The  University should review its regulations for the timetabling, conduct  and communication of examination board meetings, and best practice be  disseminated to Schools</span>.</li>

  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was studying for the award of a Diploma in Higher Education in Mental Health.     The University  declined to allow S to return to the course following a period of  maternity leave after a Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check disclosed  that S had a criminal conviction for obstructing two police officers in  the course of their duties, a conviction which S had failed to disclose  and which the University said raised concerns regarding her suitability  as a student nurse. S later explained that she did not disclose the conviction on the basis that she believed it to have been "<em>spent"</em> and that the incident in question had been a civil rather than a criminal matter.</p>
<p>S appealed the University's decision on the basis that the conviction did not relate to a criminal case.  She  said that this was supported by the fact that the original CRB check,  undertaken when she initially started the course, did not disclose the  conviction.</p>
<p>The University  referred the information provided in S's appeal to the CRB Screening  Panel ("the Panel") for further consideration.</p>
<p>S  was informed that she could continue with the theory elements of her  course pending the outcome of the Panel's consideration of the matter.</p>
<p>The Panel decided  that S should be withdrawn from the course due to the nature of the  offence, the relatively short period of time since it had been committed  (3 years) and the fact that no additional references had been provided  in support of S's character.</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA, alleging that the University had:</p>
<ul>
<li>erred in its decision that the nature of her conviction raised concerns about her suitability as a student nurse;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>failed to identify her conviction at an earlier stage; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>changed  the criteria during the process for assessing the length of time since  the offence had been committed when assessing the risk caused by the  offence; </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>failed to ask her to provide character references; and </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>allowed her to return to the programme only to withdraw her again a short time later.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons:<br /></strong><br /> The  OIA found the complaint to be Partly Justified on the basis that the  same Hospital Trust representatives sat on the original CRB Panel which  blocked S's readmission to the course and also the Panel which  reconsidered the matter following her appeal. The  OIA concluded that there was a potential perception of bias in these  circumstances and that S may have been disadvantaged by this state of  affairs.</p>
<p>The  OIA also expressed concerns that it had been provided with no evidence  as to how the Panel had voted or evidence to demonstrate that it had  been constituted in accordance with the relevant regulations. The  OIA expressed concerns that the University's regulations did not make  it clear the date from which the age of the offence should be calculated  when assessing the risk posed by it, which had caused confusion.</p>
<p>The  OIA did not, however, uphold S's complaints that the University failed  to ask her to provide additional references or that it allowed her to  restart her course only to withdraw her again. The  OIA decided that the University followed its clearly defined  regulations in these respects and that S should have been aware of the  relevant provisions.</p>
<p><span><span><strong>Recommendations:</strong></span><span><br /></span> 
<ul>
<li><span>The  OIA recommended that the University offer to put S's case before a  newly constituted CRB Screening Panel and that in the event that S  accepted the offer, the University should clarify its regulations  regarding the date from which the age of the offence is calculated when  assessing the risk posed by it.</span></li>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was a final year  Nursing student who was found guilty of minor academic misconduct in one  module. She was not referred to Fitness to Practise procedures at the  time. She passed this module upon  resubmission but failed others and was withdrawn from the course. She  made an academic appeal which was rejected.</p>
<p>She was subsequently  invited to re-join the course in error, and upon re-joining, was taken  through a Fitness to Practise process for academic misconduct, failing  to disclose cautions on her CRB record and for accepting a job offer on  the basis that she was fully qualified.</p>
<p>S was found unfit to practise.</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA that the decision was unfair because she had not been told to disclose her cautions.</p>
<p>The OIA found the complaint Not Justified.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The OIA found that  whilst the University should not have referred to the earlier academic  misconduct incident when S was going through the Fitness to Practise  process, this was corrected at the final stage of the procedure and did  not undermine the professional judgment of the Panel.</p>
<p>The OIA also found  that there had been clear guidance to students that cautions must be  disclosed and that the professional judgment of the University had been  exercised in accordance with the procedures, taking relevant evidence  into account.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong></p>
<p>The  OIA suggested that the University reviewed the way in which its Fitness  to Practise procedures were operating to ensure they adhered to the  principles of natural justice and transparency.</p>
<p>The  OIA expressed concerns that the procedures were not explicit as to the  student's right to see the evidence against them or about any right or  opportunity to appear in person and the quality of the evidence relied  upon in Panel meetings.</p></div>

    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S complained that he had missed out on a higher  degree classification as a result of getting a lower mark in his  dissertation than he had expected. He said that his dissertation  supervisor's absence from the University the month before he had been  due to submit his dissertation had meant that he had been unable to  access his supervisor for advice and guidance and that as a result of  this he achieved a lower mark.</p>
<p>S said that the supervisor had failed to give him  adequate notice of the fact that he was going on a sabbatical and he  complained that the University had failed to put into place adequate  alternative supervisory arrangements.</p>
<p>S said that if he had had access to his  supervisor to consider a draft of his dissertation, then he would have  received the advice and support that he needed to have achieved a higher  mark in the dissertation and in turn this would have allowed him to  achieve a 2:1 degree.<br /><br />The OIA found the complaint to be Not Justified.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong><br /><br /> The supervisory  arrangements made it clear that students could not expect a supervisor  to read a complete draft of the dissertation. It was also clear that S  was meant to have provided draft chapters of his work at a much earlier  stage for review and he had been advised in the handbook that work  submitted after this stage would not be reviewed by a supervisor. It was  clear that S had not complained at the time about the supervisory  arrangements and that he had been given sufficient notice of his  supervisor's absence. S did not seek additional help and advice from the  other supervisors who had been put into place for the final month  leading up to the submission of his dissertation.</p>
<p>The OIA concluded that S had sufficient  supervision and time to have contacted his supervisor for advice prior  to him leaving and that S could have identified his need for additional  support prior to him being advised of his final result.</p></div>

<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The Deputy  Adjudicator allowed the appeal stating that whilst we consider an  assessment of the impact of extenuating circumstances is largely an  academic judgement we can look at whether a University has correctly  followed its procedures in considering an extenuating circumstances  claim or appeal and whether the decision reached by the University was  reasonable based on the evidence it had before it.</p>

<p>He also complained  that the person reviewing his appeal was not in a position to judge the  validity of his complaint because it was outside their expertise.</p>
<p>The case-handler  decided that the complaint was not eligible under Rule 3.2 as the  content of the exam and assessment of the answers are matters of  academic judgment with which the OIA cannot interfere.</p>

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S  was a medical student who was withdrawn from her course. The  University's Procedures permit students to request that a decision of  the Board of Examiners be reviewed. S submitted a case for review, which  was determined to represent a <em>prima facie </em>case.  Where this is the case, the Academic Registrar is required to invite  the student and Chair of the Board to a meeting to determine an  appropriate action to remedy the situation. If, following this meeting,  the Academic Registrar and the Chair are unable to agree on appropriate  action to remedy the situation, or the student is dissatisfied with the  decision of the Academic Registrar, the matter can be escalated for  consideration by the Principal who has the power to appoint an  Assessment Review Panel. A student may include a short focussed written  statement of their case with any request for consideration by the  Principal.</p>
<p>The  Academic Registrar wrote to S outlining that a course of action to  remedy the situation had already been proposed to the Principal, and  that the meeting required by the Procedures would take place following  receipt of the Principal's response.</p>
<p>The  Principal did not agree with the proposed course of action, which would  have required the suspension of the General Regulations. Following this  decision the Academic Registrar asked the Principal whether they would  have found any grounds to appoint an Assessment Review Panel if the  matter had been referred to them as an appeal. The Principal indicated  that they did not consider there were any grounds to appoint a Panel.</p>
<p>S  complained to the University that she had not been provided with the  opportunity to attend the meeting required by the Procedures, which was  her only opportunity to state her case in person, and that the matter  had been inappropriately escalated for consideration by the Principal.</p>
<p>The  University then referred the matter for consideration by the Chair of  the University Council, as the final stage of appeal, who determined  that there had been no substantive procedural irregularities, and that S  appeared to be protesting over arrangements made in her best interests.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The  OIA found this case to be Justified because the University's procedures  required that S be provided with an opportunity to meet and discuss the  matter before a decision was made, and indicated that the matter would  only be escalated for consideration by the Principal under certain  conditions. Both of these requirements were not met, representing a  procedural irregularity.</p>
<p>If  S had been provided with an opportunity to discuss the matter, or make a  written statement, it is possible that the case put to the Principal  would have been more detailed or compelling, and a different decision  may have been reached.</p>
<p>It  was also inappropriate for the University to ask whether the Principal  would have approved an appeal after they had already made the decision  that S's situation did not warrant a suspension of the general  regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The University should offer to arrange for S's appeal to be considered afresh by an Assessment Review Panel;</li>
<li>If  S's appeal is successful the University should refer the matter to an  independent panel of the Senate, who would reconsider the Principal's  decision not to suspend the General Regulations.</li>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was studying for a three month master's level  course. There were five students on the same course as S, three of whom  were on the same strand. All three complained about various problems  that they experienced throughout the course including software problems,  lack of staff availability and other technical problems.</p>
<p>There  was a three stage Complaint Procedure at the University. Students A and  B were offered money during the procedure and accepted the sums offered  (£800 and £200 respectively). S was also offered £200 and rejected this  offer as being insufficient to compensate him for the distress and  inconvenience caused by the course being 'oversold'. S continued with  his complaint. At Stage 2 of the Complaint Procedure a Complaints  Manager ('X') was involved in advising the University that larger  payments should be offered to all three students. X's advice was not  followed. X then considered the complaint at Stage 3. Under the  Complaint Procedure this should have been an impartial, independent  review. However, X effectively endorsed the Stage 2 decision and the  lower compensation.</p>
<p><strong><span><span>Reasons</span>:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The  OIA found this complaint Justified. S suffered material disadvantage  due to defects on the course and he also suffered due to the  deficiencies in the investigation into his resulting complaint.</span></p>
<p><strong>Recommendations: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The  University should send a written apology to S for the distress, time and  energy that he had had to expend in pursuing his complaint.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Having  regard to what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances, the  University should offer to pay the sum of £1,500 to S in compensation  for the problems that he encountered  when on the Course and which affected his learning experience. This sum is made up of<strong> </strong>£1000  in compensation for the University's failure to address the problems  with the Course and also for its subsequent failure to investigate these  complaints effectively in line with the Complaints Procedure.  The additional sum of £500<strong> </strong>is for the distress and inconvenience that S has suffered due to the delay in providing an adequate remedy subsequently.</li>

  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was studying for a  nursing qualification. It was alleged that S circulated intimate  photographs of another student, X, to various Trusts and members of the  public.  X told the University that S had circulated the photographs and S was suspended from placement.</p>
<p>The University instigated disciplinary proceedings and held an initial meeting with S which was not documented. S submitted a response to the allegation following the meeting.  Further documentation was gathered by the University, including a statement from X, none of which was shown to S.</p>
<p>Following a hearing,  the University concluded that S was a party in the production of the  photographs and had failed to take adequate precautions to protect the  photographs. The association of  the circulated photographs with the University and S's involvement in  the matter had brought the name of the University into disrepute.  As a result, S was guilty of misconduct and a Final Warning was placed on S's file.</p>
<p>S appealed against  the penalty imposed on the basis of material procedural irregularity,  disregard of material evidence and perversity of judgment in the face of  the evidence presented.</p>
<p>The University rejected S's appeal.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The OIA found this complaint to be Partly Justified because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The University failed to follow the principles of natural justice as  it did not provide S with copies of all documentation prior to the  submission of S's response to the allegations.  The University also failed to provide S with copies of all documentation considered by the HEI in reaching its decision.  These failures vitiated the University's decision.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The University concluded that S admitted taking the circulated  photographs but the photographs were neither shown nor described to S  and there was no evidence that S had made such an admission.</li>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was studying for a  nursing qualification. She was granted an additional attempt at some  Semester One assessments following an extenuating circumstances claim.</p>
<p>Before she had  retaken the assessments, the University sent her a letter stating that  she had failed them and her first attempts at three Semester Two  modules. She was withdrawn from the degree. S assumed that she had been  withdrawn because she had been deemed to have failed Semester One at  final attempt. In fact, the University had not considered the Semester  One marks, although this was not apparent from the letter. The  University had withdrawn her because of too many failed Semester Two  credits. This was a procedural error; S had not exceeded the permitted  number of failed credits.</p>
<p>S appealed, providing  evidence that she had been granted a further attempt at Semester One  modules. She said that the agreement had not been honoured. The  University rejected her appeal. During this time, S resubmitted her  Semester One assignments.</p>
<p>S submitted a  complaint about the perceived failure of the University to implement the  decision about her extenuating circumstances. Unfortunately, shortly  after the complaint was submitted, the University sent S another letter  saying that she had been withdrawn from the degree; her results had been  erroneously considered by a further Examination Board. S then reported  that her results for the Semester One resits were missing. The  University had a policy not to mark work until the conclusion of the  appeals process but, exceptionally, the University then arranged for the  work to be marked. The marker was someone who had been named in S's  complaint. The work was failed, and S complained that she was being  penalised. She said that staff were obviously determined to end her  studies.</p>
<p>Following  consideration of S's complaint, the University identified that S should  not have been withdrawn under its regulations, but initially did not  uphold the complaint because S had failed the Semester One resits. The  University subsequently upheld her complaint and offered her the  opportunity to rejoin the degree, although it did not explain its  reasons. S rejected the offer because she believed that the University  was determined to fail her</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The OIA found this complaint to be Partly Justified because:</p>
<ul>
<li>There  had been a series of procedural and administrative errors. The  University had not clarified to S why she had been withdrawn, or  reassured her that her significant extenuating circumstances were not  being questioned. </li>
<li>It  was not in line with good practice to appoint a marker who knew that S  had complained about her when other markers were available.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The University to remake its offer for S to rejoin the degree and to make it clear which assessments remained outstanding.</li>
<li>The University to pay S £750 in recognition of the inconvenience and distress caused to her by its actions</li>
<li>The University to  apologise for the administrative and procedural errors that it made,  for its failure to correct them promptly, and for its poor  communications with S.</li>

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<p>S was alleged to  have committed plagiarism with a 92 per cent Turnitin match being found  with an assignment submitted to another university three years earlier.  After initially denying the allegation S admitted to the plagiarism at  the Disciplinary Committee (DC) hearing, saying that she had copied the  assignment from the internet after searching its title. In S's defence  she raised mitigating circumstances that:</p>
<ul>
<li> her grandmother passed away 10 months earlier, </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>she had a protracted Visa application that had lasted 9 months and had ended recently and </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> she had been diagnosed with insomnia 8 months earlier and was receiving ongoing treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  DC found S guilty of plagiarism and referred the matter to the  Examination Board to apply an appropriate penalty. The Examination Board  failed S's Award as it was her second upheld allegation of plagiarism. S  was awarded a lesser qualification that her completed studies entitled  her to.</p>
<p>S appealed the decision of the Examination Board unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA that the  University did not consider any of the grounds put forward. S accepted  that she had plagiarised but stated her thought process was occupied  with personal circumstances. S sought the University to reconsider its  decision.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons: </strong></p>
<p>The  OIA found the complaint Not Justified. The evidence showed that the  University considered S's mitigating circumstances. The decision not to  accept them was made on the basis that S was aware of the Extenuating  Circumstances Policy (ECP) and chose not to use it or give a reason for  failing to use it rather than committing academic dishonesty.</p>
<p>The OIA found that  this decision was reasonable given that the mitigating circumstances did  not remove S's ability to make the decision to submit extenuating  circumstances rather than submit an assignment copied from the internet.  The evidence showed S to be aware of the likely penalty and the ECP  before making the decision to plagiarise.</p>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was withdrawn from  his degree after failing several modules at the second attempt. He  appealed against the decision on a number of grounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>That two resit marks should not have been capped because S had  submitted medical evidence relating to his performance in the first  attempts. S also said that the overall module marks should not have been  capped, but rather the marks for failed components alone. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That S should have been offered a further resit in two of the failed  modules because his final assessment attempts had been affected by  incidents which he had not previously reported.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That there had been a procedural error because he had not been  credited with an examination mark for a module that he had repeated. He  had previously passed that examination and had not attended the resit  examination, believing that the pass mark would be carried forward.</li>
</ul>
<p>The University  rejected the appeal. Its regulations state that, if a student's appeal  is rejected at the initial stages on the grounds that there is no <em>prima facie</em> case, then the reasons will be explained to the student. The student  would then be offered the opportunity to resubmit the appeal. Although  S's appeal was rejected, he was not offered the opportunity to submit a  revised appeal for consideration.</p>
<p>S was not satisfied with the outcome and brought a complaint to the OIA.</p>
<p>The OIA decided that  S's complaint about the University's consideration of his medical  evidence was ineligible for review. S had previously complained about  that matter to the OIA and we had concluded that the complaint was Not  Justified. Rule 3.6 of the Scheme states that we cannot consider matters  that we have dealt with before. Furthermore, some of the issues that S  asked the OIA to look at had not been raised with the University during  the appeal process. It was decided that those issues were therefore  ineligible for review by the OIA.</p>
<p>The OIA reviewed the  matters that had been considered by the University and looked at whether  the final outcome was fair and reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The OIA concluded  that this complaint was Not Justified. The University's regulations  stated that the overall mark for a resat module would be capped. No  marks would be carried forward from previous attempts at a repeated  module. S had no evidence of the incidents that he reported.</p></div>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The  University issued a Completion of Procedures Letter on 10 March 2011 in  relation to S's formal complaint about how an incident between himself  and another student was handled. The University explained that its  procedures were completed unless S was able to establish that there was a  procedural irregularity in the University's consideration of the  complaint. It explained to S that if he did not have grounds for review,  and he remained dissatisfied, he should submit his complaint to the OIA  within three months.</p>
<p>S  identified an error in the University's Completion of Procedures Letter  dated 10 March 2011 in that it did not specify the date by which the  OIA Complaint Form needed to be submitted to the OIA, in accordance with  the OIA's Guidance.</p>
<p>S  took the complaint to the next stage in the University's procedures and  the University issued a second Completion of Procedures Letter on 16  April 2011 (which did correctly state the deadline date). S submitted  his OIA Complaint Form on 16 July 2011.</p>
<p>The  OIA found that under Rule 4.2, the issues raised in relation to S's  original complaint to the University were more than three months from  the date of receipt of the OIA Complaint Form and therefore it would  restrict its review of the complaint to the procedural issues which were  considered at the final stage of the University's processes.</p>
<p>S appealed to the Deputy Adjudicator.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The Deputy Adjudicator allowed the appeal.</p>
<p>The  Deputy Adjudicator considered that, since S decided to pursue his  complaint to the final stage in the University's procedures, it was  reasonable for him to have awaited the outcome of that final stage  before submitting his complaint to the OIA. If S had submitted his  complaint before that final stage had been completed, the OIA would have  suspended its consideration of the complaint until the outcome was  known.</p>
<p>In  the circumstances, the Deputy Adjudicator did not consider that it  would be fair to restrict our review of the complaint to the procedural  issues which were considered at the final stage of the University's  processes.</p></div>

  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S  sent his OIA Complaint Form to the OIA 5 weeks after the deadline. S  argued that the reasons for late submission were that the postal copy of  his Completions of Procedures Letter was sent to an address he had  vacated; he was unable to open the email copy immediately because he was  in Mecca for Ramadan; he was not able to give the email his full  attention because of pressure at work and personal problems and he did  not appreciate the importance of the deadline, perhaps because English  is not his first language.</p>
<p>The  OIA found that none of these reasons meant that the OIA should exercise  discretion to consider the complaint even though it was received out of  time.</p>
<p>The OIA explained that it was S's responsibility to ensure his postal address was updated and that there was a period of 10  weeks after the end of Ramadan in which S could have submitted his  complaint. It was also not unreasonable for S to have placed some weight  on reading the Completion of Procedures Letter carefully especially as  during this time he contacted the University regarding his complaint.  The OIA found there was a good level of English in S's correspondence  and that the University had clearly explained the steps S should take to  bring his complaint to the OIA.</p>
<p>S appealed to the Deputy Adjudicator.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The Deputy Adjudicator upheld the decision and agreed with the decisions made by the Assistant Adjudicator.</p>
<p>There was no evidence  that S's language skills were so poor he was unable to understand the  statement in the Completion of Procedures Letter about the deadline to  complain to the OIA. The Deputy Adjudicator noted that S had sought  assistance with his OIA Complaint Form and therefore had he not been  able to understand the Completion of Procedures Letter the OIA would  have expected him to have sought assistance upon its receipt.</p></div>

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Reasons</strong>:</p>
<p>Three students were assessed as owing money for damages (in particular communal damages) for accommodation in two separate halls of residence 9 months after they had left their halls. The university stopped various academic services (such as IT, provision of a bursary and library facilities) in the students' second and third academic years when the students disputed the monies owed through the university's complaints mechanism and subsequently when they were taking their cases to the OIA.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>The OIA concluded that the complaints were Justified on the basis that the University did not adequately prove that the students were responsible for the alleged damages nor had it given them a contemporaneous opportunity to check the evidence as to the alleged damage.<br /> <br /> In addition, the University did not warn the students, whilst they were in their halls of residence, that they could lose access to other educational services if they did not pay subsequently for any communal or other damages arising from this tenancy. For example one of the students had IT services withheld although he had paid the relevant tuition fees of £3,225 each year and when the disputed amount of communal damages totalled £60.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The University to offer to repay the relevant      damages (or apply a waiver in the cases where students withheld the      amount) plus £200 each for distress and inconvenience. </li>
<li>The University to undertake a review of its      policies as to the withholding of university services and bursaries in the      event of outstanding accommodation debts generally and with particular      reference to damages charges such as these, with a view to severing the      link between such outstanding charges and the contract to supply      educational facilities. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Good Practice Suggestions</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>The University's      departure e-mail (which it sends to student tenants in the last month of      the summer term) should set out all the arrangements for inspecting the      rooms after students leave and the date by which students will receive any      bill for communal or other damages. This date should be no more than three      months after the student has vacated the flat. The University should      ensure that all evidence of damage discovered during the end of tenancy      inspection should be sent to the relevant students, within one month of      the tenancy ending, along with evidence in the form of photographs, copy      inventories etc so that students are unambiguously informed as to their      responsibility for all loss and damage and have the opportunity to provide      any other relevant counter-evidence before a bill for damages is issued.</em></li>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>Two first year students occupied a flat on the top floor of a residence. The hall was advertised and let as a University property but was owned by a private company. There was a problem with the roof of which the University was aware (a major refurbishment was planned in the following year by the company) which meant that the flat suffered a water leak during autumn. This was reported to the University, by the students, in November/December and temporary measures such as the provision of buckets to catch water and the drying of carpets were undertaken by the University.</p>
<p>The students were told that they could move to separate flats, if their health was at risk, part way through the following year and that the major repair to fix the roof would take place in April/May 2010. The students did not want to be split up from their flatmates at this point and also pointed out that they had to concentrate on assessments. The students then formally complained about the damp problem that they had endured for most of an academic year and asked for appropriate compensation. The University offered a rebate of £2 for each affected week (a total sum of £72). The students rejected this offer as too low.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons</strong>:</p>
<p>The OIA concluded that the students' complaint was Justified on the basis that the University did not react quickly enough to remedy the problem, to ensure that the private company carried out the repairs immediately or to offer alternative accommodation to all the residents in the affected flat in the autumn.</p>
<p>The University had advertised the hall as being covered by the UUK Accommodation Code, which should have meant an urgent repair within five days, although the exact time frame was not made clear in the University's information to the students. The flat was also covered separately by the ANUK Code which meant a Priority Two repair within five working days. The University had not published this particular information in the relevant literature.</p>
<p>The OIA was critical of the University for not acting to remedy the situation once it was evident that there was a damp problem and also for offering such a small amount of compensation once it accepted that the students had suffered the consequences of a water leak for around six months.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The University to offer a total sum of £850 in      compensation to each student - £600 by way of rent rebate for failing to      take responsibility for the repairs in a timely fashion </li>
<li>£250 for the subsequent distress and      inconvenience and time and trouble in bringing their complaint.</li>

    <br /><p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<p>S was an international postgraduate student supported by a grant from his government. He submitted a complaint regarding the supervision and feedback he had received. This was upheld and the University refunded his government the money it had awarded to S in relation to his fees and living expenses (over £56,000). However, it rejected S's request for personal compensation.</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA that he had not received appropriate compensation in relation to three years' wasted effort, additional living expenses not covered by the government grant, loss of earnings and damage to his reputation etc. He sought additional compensation of £60,000.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons</strong>:</p>
<p>The OIA found this complaint to be Justified on the basis that the University accepted there were shortcomings for which it was responsible, but had not offered S appropriate and proportionate compensation for his personal losses.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong>:</p>
<p>The University to offer to pay S the sum of £10,000 for three years of lost time, the loss of opportunity to obtain his PhD and the disappointment, distress and inconvenience caused. The amount recommended took into account that, while S had made the decision to take leave from his job and give up his salary for the opportunity to study for a PhD, there was no guarantee that he would have obtained this qualification.</p>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was registered on a MBA course. His concerns centred on his dissertation, and primarily his dissertation supervisor. Following the submission of S's dissertation the University raised and investigated an allegation of plagiarism. The outcome of the investigation was that the University viewed some of his work to be directly copied from other sources but it decided not to pursue a formal case of plagiarism against him on this occasion. The dissertation was returned to be marked on its academic merits.</p>
<p>S was unhappy with his dissertation mark and raised the following concerns with the University:</p>
<ul>
<li>His supervisor caused the plagiarism allegation      to be made against him. Following the allegation his supervisor took a      negative attitude towards him and the marking of his dissertation. </li>
<li>He did not receive reasonable support with his      dissertation. </li>
<li>His supervisor changed his view of the      dissertation based on an article which S believes should not be considered      due to the short time between its publication and when his dissertation      had to be submitted. S also questioned the accuracy of the article. </li>
</ul>
<p>On receipt of S's complaint the University stated that if S accepted his award at the forthcoming Awards Ceremony, in 11 days time, he could not continue with his complaint.</p>
<p>S chased the University's response to his complaint after 6 days as his Awards Ceremony was approaching. The University did not respond until the morning of the Awards Ceremony which S attended, without knowing of the response.</p>
<p>The University's response (on the morning of the Awards Ceremony) dismissed the complaint with no elements being upheld. S responded on the same day raising concerns about the timing of the University's response. S then appealed the University's decision.</p>
<p>The University dismissed the appeal saying: "S has significantly undermined his complaint by accepting his award in the knowledge that this would end the consideration of his complaint."</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The OIA found the complaint to be Partly Justified for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There was evidence of a lack of proper      investigation of the complaint at the first stage, including failing to      address reasonably S's request for a meeting and delegating the      investigation against its regulations. </li>
<li>There was no evidence that the University      considered if S was given reasonable supervision. </li>
<li>There was potentially biased marking given the      plagiarism allegation and the markers' comments and this was not      considered. </li>
<li>The University put unreasonable pressure on S to      withdraw his complaint or not attend his award ceremony. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The University to offer S compensation of £400      for the distress and inconvenience caused to him by its failure to address      his concerns reasonably and the unreasonable pressure put on him. </li>
<li>The University to reconsider if S was given      reasonable support by his dissertation supervisor. </li>
<li>The University to reconsider if there was      potentially biased marking of his dissertation. </li>

<li>the course content at the overseas University was not of a suitable academic level; </li>
<li>the course duration was shorter than he expected; </li>
<li>the University should not have recommended the overseas University to him and </li>
<li>he lost a great deal of time and money.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<div>The OIA found the complaint to be Partly Justified because it was  not  reasonable for the University to have made it solely the student's   responsibility to ensure that courses offered by the host University  were a  suitable match for their home University modules. The University  should have  given more support and played a more active role in  ensuring that the host  institutions offered suitably matching courses  for students.</div>
<div>There was a lack of thoroughness and transparency when responding  to S's  complaint. It was not until S made a complaint to the OIA that S  became aware of  certain information relevant to the complaint,  including some concerns about the  academic content.</div>
<p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The University to offer S £500 in compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused to S by the failings identified in the University's handling of the complaint </li>
<li>The University to undertake a review of the operation of its Student Complaints Procedure in order to address issues of insufficient thoroughness and a lack of transparency in the complaint process. </li>
<li>The University to review the Study Abroad Programme process to consider whether it should play a more active role in ensuring that host institutions offer suitably matching courses for students and to lessen the burden of responsibility on participating students.</li>

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S was studying for a PGCE. There was a delay in S starting her first placement because the University had difficulty finding schools that were able to offer a placement to S and some other students. When a placement was found, S missed the first day without notifying the University or the School. The University asked for an explanation and S said that the placement was too far away (although it was one of the University's partner schools) and she felt unsafe walking through the campus very early in the morning, while it was still dark, to catch the coach that the University had provided to take her and other students to their placements. The University arranged for S to walk across campus with some other students and she successfully completed the first placement.</p>
<p>S missed the start of her second placement because of ill health. After S had completed a few weeks on placement, her performance was was observed by the school's Deputy Head Teacher who said that S's performance was unsatisfactory and an action plan needed to be put in place. S was unhappy with the way that the Deputy Head Teacher advised her of this and said that she had not previously been made aware of any problems with her performance. The next day S left the placement and advised the school of this decision by text message. She then told the University that she was leaving the PGCE. Some weeks later S asked the University if she could defer her place on the PGCE and complete the second placement at another school when she felt ready.</p>
<p>The University's Exam Board considered this request and decided that S should not be allowed to re-sit the second placement because she had acted unprofessionally whilst on placement. S was awarded a lesser qualification.</p>
<p>S was unhappy with the University's decision and brought a complaint to the OIA.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The OIA found this complaint to be Not Justified on the basis that students were made aware of the need to act professionally and were specifically advised that they should not absent themselves from a placement. S did not seek any advice from the University before leaving either the placement or the course. Although S did subsequently ask for a deferral, the course guidance stated that re-sitting a placement was a not a right and that the Exam Board would decide whether or not a student should be given a further attempt. In this case the academic and professional judgment of the Exam Board was that S should not be permitted to re-sit the placement. Under its Rules the OIA cannot interfere with academic judgment and will not generally interfere with professional judgment, unless there is evidence of procedural irregularity, unfairness or bias, which was not the case here.</p></div>

    <a href="#" class="accordianTitle2">Case Study 40<span class="accordianTitle3"><br />Issues: Supervision<br />Outcome: <strong>Not justified</strong></span></a>
  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<p>S was an undergraduate student undertaking an independent project as part of her final year. S expressed concerns about the availability of her supervisor who had gone abroad on two occasions during the independent project. S was also concerned about the fact that she had not secured ethical approval for her independent project before her supervisor left the country. S subsequently applied for an extension to the submission deadline and this was refused. S received a mark of 54 for the project and overall an award of 2:2 for her degree.</p>
<p>S appealed against this decision on the grounds of poor supervision and the delay in granting her ethical approval. The University rejected the appeal on the grounds that even though the supervisor had not been available in person S had been in e-mail and telephone contact. It concluded that as this was an independent piece of work then S could not expect the level of supervision that she wanted. The University also concluded that another tutor had been available to S in the period that her supervisor was abroad.  It noted that S had been told when to submit her ethical approval form and that, having been given advice by her supervisor in relation to this, she had then failed to submit the form in good time. It pointed out that it had sought to turn around ethical approval as quickly as possible and concluded that it was not responsible for the delay.</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA that the University had failed to take into account the impact of her supervisor being abroad and stated that e-mails and telephone calls were not an adequate substitute for face to face meetings. S also said that the delay in granting her ethical approval and how this had affected her ability to complete the project had not been fully considered. She said that had it not been for these factors she would have achieved a higher mark in the independent project and a higher degree classification overall.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The OIA found this complaint to be Not Justified. We were satisfied that the supervision offered had met the University's published details on supervision and that this was an independent piece of work. S's expectations of supervision were unreasonable and she had not demonstrated that the supervisor's absence had caused her substantial disadvantage.</p>
<p>In addition, the OIA concluded that S had not followed the directions of her supervisor or the published advice on the submission of the ethics form and that she had therefore been responsible for the late submission of this form.  The evidence provided to the OIA showed that the University had processed this form in a reasonable time in all the circumstances.</p></div>

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S complained about the University's decision not to admit him to a nursing programme as a result of a CRB check. During the OIA's consideration as to whether the complaint was eligible under its Rules it became apparent that it was unclear whether S was a "registered student". The University confirmed to the OIA that S was not a "registered student" and therefore the OIA found the complaint was not eligible because under rule 3.1 of the Rules of the Scheme, the OIA is unable to consider matters of admissions to a University.</p>
<p>S appealed to the Deputy Adjudicator.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The Deputy Adjudicator allowed S's appeal.</p>
<p>S provided evidence that he was registered as a student by providing a registration number and confirmation that he had started attending classes. Although the University confirmed that it allows a student to continue attending classes pending the CRB outcome, the OIA was satisfied that S was a "registered student" for the purposes of our Rules because he was allowed to begin the course and was permitted to access the University's facilities and processes. S's complaint was therefore accepted for OIA review.</p></div>

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>S completed the University's internal complaints procedures and submitted a Scheme Application Form in December 2010. The Completion of Procedures Letter was dated February 2010. S cited being under stress as a reason for the late submission but had provided no medical evidence to support this. The OIA advised S that her complaint was not eligible under Rule 4.2 of the Scheme because her Scheme Application Form was sent more than three months after the date of the University's Completion of Procedures letter.</p>
<p>S appealed to the Deputy Adjudicator.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons:</strong></p>
<p>The Deputy Adjudicator confirmed the original decision.</p>
<p>It was clear that S had been provided with a Completion of Procedures Letter which informed her to contact the OIA if she was dissatisfied and referred her to the OIA's website. S asserted in her appeal that she was unable to access information about how to complain to the OIA whilst she was in her home country; however, it was apparent from the evidence she was in contact with the University during this period and had been directed to the OIA and to her students' union. The Deputy Adjudicator also concluded there was insufficient medical evidence to dis-apply the usual time limits.</p></div>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was a student at the University in 1999/2000 and complained that he was not informed by the university that he had to repeat his project within two years. Due to financial constraints he decided not to progress the matter until 2009 and discovered that he was no longer permitted to do so.</p>
<p>The OIA considered that under Rule 4.5 it 'would not normally consider a complaints where it considers that the substantive events complaint about occurred more than three years before the Complaint Form is received'. It was therefore found that this complaint was ineligible.</p>
<p>S appealed to the Deputy Adjudicator.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The Deputy Adjudicator confirmed the previous decision.  She concluded that it would not be possible to conduct a fair review of events in 1999/2000 and observed that it was likely that important documents will have been destroyed and recollections of the individuals concerned will have faded.</p></div>

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S submitted an appeal to the University.  There were three stages to the University's appeal procedures.  The student completed the first two stages but did not escalate his appeal to the final third stage.  In the University's response to the second stage appeal, the student was signposted to the final stage of the appeals procedure and it also said that if the student did not submit a stage three appeal within the relevant timescale, it would assume that the student wished to withdraw the appeal and abide by the original decision of the Exam Board.  When the student did not escalate the appeal, the University sent the student a Completion of Procedures letter.  The OIA decided that the student's complaint was not eligible under rule Rule 4.1 of our Scheme Rules set out below:</p>
<p>'A complainant must have first exhausted the internal complaints procedures of the HEI complained about before bringing a complaint to the OIA. In exceptional circumstances a Reviewer may accept a complaint for review even if the internal complaints procedures of the HEI have not been exhausted if he or she considers it appropriate to do so.'</p>
<p>The OIA could find not any exceptional circumstances in the student's Complaint Form for not completing the University's internal procedures.</p>
<p>S appealed to the Deputy Adjudicator.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The Deputy Adjudicator confirmed the original decision.  She concluded that S's appeal fell within the permitted grounds for stage 3 of the University's procedures, and S had not provided evidence of exceptional circumstances for not progressing her appeal to stage 3.  The Deputy Adjudicator noted that the University explained the implications of not proceeding to the next stage of the appeals procedure.  She also noted that the University issued a Completion of Procedures Letter  which confirmed that its internal procedures were concluded and which stated that the student 'may be able to complain' to the OIA, 'provided [his] complaint [was] eligible under its Rules.'  The Deputy Adjudicator noted that the University had issued the Completion of Procedures Letter correctly because S had no further recourse within the University because he had not complied with the time limit for progressing his appeal.</p></div>

    <br /><p>S was issued with a Completion of Procedures Letter and an unsigned Form was received one day late. A further signed Complaint Form was received 8 days later.</p>
<p>There is discretion to accept complaints after the deadline under Rule 4.2 of the OIA Scheme Rules which says:</p>
<p>'The OIA will not normally consider a complaint unless it is received within three months from the date upon which the internal complaints procedures [of the University] were exhausted except where the Reviewer extends the time because he or she is satisfied that there is good reason to do so.'</p>
<p>S was therefore asked provide reasons and independent evidence if there were exceptional reasons as to why the form was not submitted within the three months.</p>
<p>S stated that the reason for the delay as a minor operation and said that evidence would be provided. S subsequently submitted medical evidence which described a back pain and did not mention the unrelated operation.  It was dated before the Completion of Procedures Letter was issued.</p>
<p>S appealed to the Deputy Adjudicator.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The Deputy Adjudicator confirmed the decision.  She concluded that the certificate did not amount to a good reason to waive the normal time limit as it related to a period of one week before the Completion of Procedures Letter was issued, and did not cover the three month period during which the Complaint Form ought to have been submitted. As no evidence regarding S's operation was submitted the OIA were unable to assess whether it amounted to a good reason to waive time limits.</p></div>

  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S wished to bring a complaint to the OIA about her former supervisor when she was enquiring about being readmitted to the University. However, the substantive events complained about took place more than three years ago. Under Rule 4.5 the 'OIA will not normally consider a complaint where it considers that the substantive events complained about occurred more than three years before the Complaint Form is received by the OIA'.</p>
<p>The OIA also considered that part of the complaint related to an admissions issue, something the OIA cannot consider under Rule 2 of the OIA Scheme Rules.</p>
<p>S appealed to the Deputy Adjudicator and argued that she was effectively suspended and not withdrawn from her studies.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The Deputy Adjudicator confirmed the decision.  She was satisfied that S was withdrawn from her studies and that S could have complained about this decision at the time. That decision, and the events involving her supervisor, were more than three years ago and there were no reasons to waive the OIA's normal rule.  The Deputy Adjudicator agreed that University reasonably treated S's subsequent requests to recommence her studies as an admissions matter which is outside the OIA's remit.</p></div>

    <br /><p>S's Complaint Form was received six days after the three month deadline. The OIA advised S that her complaint was not eligible under Rule 4.2 of the Scheme because her Complaint Form was sent more than three months after the date of the University's Completion of Procedures letter. S had also been reminded of the relevant time frame in correspondence with the University. The OIA considered that there is discretion under Rule 4.2 to accept the complaint where there is 'good reason to do so'. However, S had only provided limited medical evidence to support her argument that she was unable to submit her Complaint Form before the deadline.</p>
<p>S appealed to the Deputy Adjudicator.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The Deputy Adjudicator considered that a complaint about the original appeal was out of time. However, it was clear that S wanted to complain about the outcome of  the reassessment not the decision on the original appeal. S did not have a Completion of Procedures Letter relating to the reassessment.</p>
<p>The OIA found that there was no further right of appeal within the University following a reassessment and therefore it appeared that the University's procedures were complete. The OIA therefore asked the University either to issue a further Completion of Procedures Letter or advise S on what further steps she need to take to obtain one.</p></div>

  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Course/Professional Body</strong>:  Social Work; General Social Care Council (GSCC)</p>
<p>S was enrolled on a BSc in Social Work. Before offering students a place on the course, the University required them to complete a form disclosing any previous convictions. S disclosed one motoring conviction for which she had received a 28 day ban. The University did not consider this to be serious and offered S a place on the course.</p>
<p>Before starting her second year placement, S was required to complete an application for an Enhanced Criminal Records Disclosure from the Criminal Records Bureau, as a result of which two further motoring convictions, which S had not previously disclosed to the University, came to light. The University convened a Cause for Concern Meeting at which S explained the reasons for the non-disclosure. At the same meeting, S was asked to prepare an anonymised written explanation of the circumstances surrounding the additional convictions and the reasons why she had not disclosed them. S was informed that her written statement would be forwarded to two of the University's partner agencies who were responsible for offering placements. Their comments and S's statement would then be considered by the University's Convictions Panel ("Convictions Panel") under the University's healthcare students screening procedure ("the Screening Procedure").</p>
<p>The Screening Procedure required the details of offences to be outlined to partner agencies for a response as to: "…whether they would be in a position to potentially offer a placement or employ someone with the stated offences."</p>
<p>S's course leader sent S's statement with the University's pro forma letter to the partner agencies. The letter asked the agencies to indicate whether they would be able to offer S a placement given her circumstances; whether S met the standards of conduct they would expect of social care staff and whether "… her convictions and current concerns should preclude her from being employed within your agency."</p>
<p>Both partner agencies indicated that they would not offer a placement to a student in S's circumstances and when the Convictions Panel subsequently met, it decided that S should be withdrawn from her course. When S's case was referred to the University's Termination of Studies Panel, she submitted mitigating circumstances with supporting evidence in the form of medical certificates, court records relating to her convictions, testimonials from professional referees and her more detailed explanation of the events surrounding her convictions. S's course leader, who was present at the hearing, informed the Termination of Studies Panel that as the partner agencies would not offer S a placement, the case was outside of the University's control because the University could not keep a student without a placement on the course.</p>
<p>The Termination of Studies Panel subsequently recommended that S be withdrawn and this was later confirmed by the Exam Board. S requested a review of the decision on the grounds of material administrative error. S was subsequently notified that her appeal had been rejected.</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA that:</p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>the University did not properly consider the mitigating circumstances she submitted to the Termination of Studies Panel; </li>
<li>she was told the partner agencies would be contacted via a letter containing anonymised details of her case together with a copy of her written statement. However, email correspondence between the University and one of the agencies suggested that her circumstances had been the subject of several telephone conversations. S was concerned that her anonymity had not been preserved and that a fair process had not been followed in her case.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The Termination of Studies Panel did not meet in private at the end of the hearing to consider the evidence and this procedural flaw amounted to a breach of the principles of natural justice (the duty to act fairly). The OIA found that there was no record of any decision by the Termination of Studies Panel in relation to S's mitigating circumstances and that the evidence showed the Panel had accepted the arguments made by S's course leader without properly considering S's submissions. The OIA also found that the questions put to the partner agencies in the University's pro forma letter, and the information provided to them, went beyond what was required under the Screening Procedure. This meant that the agencies were provided with information which they should not have seen and asked to provide an opinion on matters which were beyond their remit under the Screening Procedure. As a consequence, both the Convictions Panel and the Termination of Studies Panel considered opinions about S which were unfairly obtained. The OIA found that the absence of any record of the conversations between the University and one partner agency about S's case was unfair to S because of the lack of transparency.</p>
<p>Finally, the OIA found that the University treated S's request for a review of the Exam Board's decision as an appeal. This was incorrect as, under the University's procedures, S was entitled to present her case to an Appeals Panel for a decision to be reached about whether she should be given leave to appeal and this did not happen.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>the University to reconsider S's case at a fresh Termination of Studies Panel, ensuring that procedures for hearing and considering S's evidence in private are followed and giving reasons for its decision;</li>
<li>fresh opinions to be sought from different partner agencies in relation to S's case. The partner agencies to be asked only whether they would be in a position to offer a placement to someone in S's situation, and to be provided only with anonymised details of the offences and dates;</li>
<li>those opinions to be requested, and presented to the Termination of Studies Panel, by someone with no previous involvement in S's case.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Observations:</span></p>
<p>The OIA made the following suggestions:</p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>that Enhanced Criminal Records checks be carried out before admission to the social work course, in line with the procedure for other health and social care courses and GSCC guidance;</li>
<li>that the University keeps clear records of all deliberations and decisions, with reasons.</li>

  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Course/Professional Body</strong>:  Midwifery; Nursing and Midwifery Council</p>
<p>S was registered on a BSc Midwifery Course which was 18 months long. Under the requirements of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) the student was required to complete the course within 2.5 years of registering. S had successfully completed the academic elements of the course.</p>
<p>She failed her first placement but following a successful appeal was permitted to retake the placement as if for the first time. S failed the second placement but again made a successful appeal and was allowed to take the placement again. S failed the third placement. Under the course regulations S would have been permitted a fourth attempt to pass the placement which would have constituted her second formal attempt as the first two attempts had been disregarded.</p>
<p>After the third placement S was referred to a Practice Enquiry Panel. This was standard practice after a failed placement. At the Practice Enquiry Panel concerns were raised by a placement midwife about S's fitness to practise. The matter was referred to a Fitness to Practise Panel. The Fitness to Practise Panel concluded that S was not fit to practise and was withdrawn from the course. S appealed against the decision. A Disciplinary Appeal Panel upheld the appeal on the grounds that there had been a material procedural irregularity in the conduct of the Fitness to Practise Panel. The case was referred back to a newly formed Fitness to Practise Panel to decide whether S was fit to practise.</p>
<p>The second Fitness to Practise Panel concluded that S was fit to practise and should be given another placement. Unfortunately the original Trust would not provide another placement and the University was required to find another provider. S was informed of the outcome and her attention was drawn to the NMC deadline for completion.</p>
<p>The University wrote to S to say that the NMC would not extend the deadline for completing the course. Any second attempt placement had to be 4 weeks in length and so there was insufficient time for S to complete the placement. The University had no option but to withdraw her from the course.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>S submitted a complaint to the University and a hearing was held 3 months after submission. The Complaint Panel concluded that there had been unreasonable delays and that a letter of apology should be issued to S. It also recommended changes to Department Procedures. It recommended that S should be readmitted to the Midwifery Programme subject to a placement being offered by a Trust and other relevant checks being obtained. The Department to make every reasonable effort to support S in finding a suitable placement and to meet the cost of readmission in the event that the Strategic Health Authority was unable to fund her.</p>
<p>The University was unable to find a Trust that would accommodate S and therefore was unable to satisfactorily resolve S's complaint.</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA that:</p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>the first Fitness to Practise Panel took 50 days to convene instead of 20;</li>
<li>the appeal took 90 days to be heard. The Appeal Panel also comprised academics who could not decide fitness to practise issues. It upheld her appeal but had to refer the decision back to the Fitness to Practise Panel;</li>
<li>the second Fitness to Practise Panel declared her fit to practise but with only four weeks to run of the two and half years stipulated by the NMC she would not be able to complete the placement in time; and</li>
<li>the complaint took longer than it should.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OIA found the complaint to be justified because there were unreasonable delays in convening the first Fitness to Practise and the Appeal Panels.</p>
<p>S's appeal was upheld as the first Fitness to Practise Panel failed to observe the University's procedures and principles of natural justice. Had it done so S may not have been obliged to appeal. However, there was no certainty that S would pass the repeat placement or that the University would be able to find a placement for her, but S lost the opportunity to complete her midwifery course.</p>
<p>It was noted that the University did endeavour to obtain a time extension from the NMC and obtain an alternative placement if S chose to repeat the course. It also offered to meet the costs if S was unable to obtain funding. The University did provide an apology for the delay in arranging the first fitness to practise panel but not in relation to the delays in the appeal process.</p>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Course/Professional Body</strong>: Counselling</p>
<p>S was studying for a Postgraduate Diploma in Counselling which required students to attend a clinical placement involving a minimum of 150 practice hours and at least 40 individual weekly supervision sessions. Five months into the course S was advised that he was to be held back from his placement because of concerns about his behaviour. S began his placement a year after joining the course. He received an "unsatisfactory" final supervision report. The External Examiner who considered the report said that a second placement was not appropriate because the report raised issues of unethical working and client risk together with some doubt that an improvement in performance would be likely.</p>
<p>The Exam Board agreed to recommend that S fail the course at the first attempt and be denied a second attempt at the placement because reassessment would entail an unacceptable risk for clients under the University's regulations. S appealed against the decision and asked to repeat the placement. The Appeals Panel rejected his appeal.</p>
<p>S made a second appeal to the Review Panel which agreed to recommend that S should be allowed to repeat the placement subject to a number of conditions. As the Review Panel proposed to vary the student's result it was required to seek the view of the External Examiner. The External Examiner refused to endorse the recommendation so the decision was referred to the University's Final Review Panel. The Final Review Panel rejected the Review Panel's recommendation and upheld the Exam Board's decision not to allow a second placement.</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA that the University's decision to refuse him a second placement was not justified because:</p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>there was no evidence to support the view that a second placement posed an unacceptable risk to clients;</li>
<li>he received inadequate tutorial support;</li>
<li>prior to the unsatisfactory final report he was not told of the alleged deficiencies in his performance or the possible consequences. His first and second reports were that his performance was satisfactory; and</li>
<li>the Appeals Process was flawed. In particular the External Examiner may have been unfairly influenced by the Department who he contacted to discuss the case with after the Review Panel. The External Examiner may therefore have taken into account matters occurring after the decision to withdraw him from the course when he advised the Review Panel that he did not support its decision that S should be allowed to repeat the placement.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The OIA's overall finding was that S's complaint was partly justified. The OIA considered the aspect of S's complaint that the Appeal Process was flawed to be justified. No finding was made in respect of S's other substantive complaints as they were not considered in the OIA's review in order to avoid prejudicing any further action that the OIA required the University to take because S's procedural complaint was justified.</p>
<p>The OIA found the procedural aspect of S's complaint to be justified because while the Regulations did not prohibit the External Examiner contacting staff prior to making a recommendation to the Final Review Panel, it is a fundamental principle of procedural fairness that parties to a dispute be allowed an equal opportunity to be heard before the decision maker. Both S and the Department were able to put their case to the Review Panel but the Department could not persuade the Panel that S should not have a second placement. While it was the External Examiner who contacted the Department and the Department may not have intended to influence the External Examiner's decision, the result was that the Department had another opportunity to influence the decision maker that S should not have a second placement.</p>
<p>It was considered to be a rare situation where the Final Review Panel would disagree with an External Examiner as to whether a student should have a second opportunity. The consequences of not being allowed a further placement are grave. As such it is of the utmost importance that the process by which the External Examiner reached their decision complies with the principles of procedural fairness and is procedurally beyond reproach.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>That the University offer to refer S's case to another External Examiner (who has not been previously involved in the case) for a recommendation as to whether or not S should be allowed a second placement.</li>
<li>The new External Examiner should have all the information presented to the Review Panel and should be advised their decision should be based solely on the documentation without discussion with the Department.</li>
<li>If the new External Examiner refuses to endorse the Review Panel's recommendation that S be allowed a second placement, the decision should again be made by the Final Review Panel.</li>

<p>S was registered on a MBChB course. Following the submission of a report she was informed by her Supervisor that there was suspected plagiarism. S then attended a Department interview where she agreed that she had committed plagiarism. In mitigation she said that she had submitted a draft version of her report rather than the final draft. She was advised that her report would receive zero marks and that the matter was going to be referred to a Fitness to Practise Panel due to the severity of her plagiarism.<br /><br />The University on recognising that S had not been advised of her appeal rights against the Department decision, decided to treat her submission to the Fitness to Practise Panel as her appeal. It did not uphold her appeal on the grounds that S was responsible for ensuring that the correct version of the report had been submitted and that the plagiarism had been evident. It concluded that the penalty was reasonable and consistent.<br /><br />S complained about the following:</p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>that the finding of plagiarism was not sustainable and that the penalty was not proportionate;</li>
<li>that the University had not followed its own procedures.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The OIA found the complaint partly justified because the University did not discharge its obligations in line with its regulations. It failed to consider the matter of intent when measuring the seriousness of the offence and considering what penalty to impose. The complaint about the finding of plagiarism was not upheld, as in general terms the nature and extend of plagiarism is an academic judgment and therefore outside the remit of the OIA Scheme.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>vacate the penalty that had been imposed;</li>
<li>refer the matter back to the Department for reconsideration, ensuring that the matter of intent was considered;</li>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p><strong>Course/Professional Body: </strong>Teaching; General Teaching Council</p>
<p>S was registered on a PGCE course. S received a fail for her final placement portfolio because she had not achieved some of the required practical teaching standards. S complained, arguing that this was due to the inadequacy of the placement. Having acknowledged some deficiencies of the placement, the University agreed to allow S another attempt and identified an alternative placement school. S rejected the alternative on the grounds that she had been given insufficient notice and that the school was too far from her home. The University subsequently notified her that her registration was being terminated under a clause in the terms and conditions of registration which said: "The University may terminate your Registration Agreement at any time if a partner school cannot be contracted which is willing to support you for any part of the course."</p>
<p>S lodged a complaint about her original placement school and noted that the University had terminated her registration on the basis of a condition which was not in her contract. In response, the University argued its decision to offer her an alternative placement had been reasonable. It said that S had not received the correct contract and that as S had rejected the alternative placement, her registration would now be terminated under a different provision, on the grounds of her failure either to make satisfactory progress or to complete her course within a three year period. S's appeal under the final stage of the Complaints Procedure was rejected by the University.</p>
<p><br />S complained to the OIA that:</p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>there were significant problems with her final teaching placement which the University did not properly address;</li>
<li>an alternative placement was offered at short notice and at a considerable distance from S's home;</li>
<li>S's registration was terminated under a clause which was not in her contract and before the expiry of the time in which she was allowed to qualify.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The OIA found that for many of the issues raised by S, there was no independent evidence that could be interpreted to support either party. The University's decision not to investigate the details of S's first complaint and to offer her an alternative placement was taken in the best interests of S. The University later carried out a detailed investigation at the final stage of the Complaints Procedure.</p>
<p>There was a shortage of placements and the University made an exhaustive search for an alternative school. The OIA found that although the allocated placement was further away than would have been ideal, in the circumstances it was not unreasonable to expect S to undertake the travel for a twelve-week period.</p>
<p>The OIA found a lack of clarity in the way the University had applied its regulations to terminate S's registration but that it was entitled to do so as S had rejected a reasonable offer of a placement. For this reason the University was justified in considering that S was responsible for her own lack of progress. The OIA found that it was reasonable for the University to conclude that it would be unlikely to find another placement for S and that there was no benefit to S in continuing her registration.</p></div>

    <br /><p><strong>Course/Professional Body</strong>: Nursing (Mental Health); Nursing and Midwifery Council</p>
<p>S was studying for a DipHE in Nursing (Mental Health). During S's first placement, the Hospital made the University aware of concerns regarding S's attitude, poor motivation and use of his mobile phone. After these were discussed with S there were no further problems and he successfully completed the  placement. During the second placement post-placement interview S's social skills were discussed and identified as an area for further learning because S came across as aggressive, rude and abrupt. When S failed an assignment he sought out the Tutor and told her he should have passed. The Tutor felt  intimidated by S's demeanour and by the fact he had sought her out.</p>
<p>S was involved in an incident with a patient with a history of mental health issues. When the patient refused to return to his room, S  approached the patient which escalated the situation and S physically restrained the patient. The University suspended S from his clinical placement as it was concerned his actions might constitute assault but S was able to continue attending University. A Disciplinary Panel decided that while S had mismanaged the situation he could return to his placement as he had not acted inappropriately and no further action should be taken against him.</p>
<p>The time taken for his hearing to proceed meant S missed his fifth placement and the start of his sixth. S  visited the relevant department a few days after his hearing to find out when he could rejoin his cohort on placement. He became angry and shouted accusations of racism when he learnt that the Hospital would not allow him to start his placement until it had received formal notification that there was no sanction against him. S subsequently rejoined his cohort on the seventh placement. Towards the end S was told there were concerns that he was not achieving an adequate level of competency and his behaviour was unsatisfactory, in particular his lack of punctuality, use of his mobile phone and falling asleep at work. During a subsequent Hospital staff meeting, S's mobile phone rang despite previous instruction that mobile phones should be switched off while staff were working. After the meeting the Regulations were discussed with S and he was asked to leave the Hospital and return the following week. S became aggressive and hostile and refused to leave. After eventually doing so, S did not return to the placement. When the University was told of these events it referred S to a Fitness to Practise Panel.</p>
<p>The Panel concluded that the three incidents of aggression along with the other concerns that had been raised showed a pattern of unprofessional and inappropriate behaviour which was incompatible with the nursing profession. S was withdrawn from the course but was not excluded from the University. S lodged an appeal. The Appeals Panel decided that the primary cause for concern was S's perceived aggressive behaviour. S had been repeatedly told of these concerns but any improvements were not sustained. The Appeals Panel concluded that when the Fitness to Practise Panel had decided he was not fit to practise it had no option but to withdraw him.</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA that:</p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>he had not been made fully aware of the problems with, and consequences of, his behaviour;</li>
<li>the Fitness to Practise Panel's decision that he should be withdrawn was too severe</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The OIA found the complaint to be not justified because there was sufficient evidence that the University explained to S the problems with his behaviour and it would have been implicit in these discussions that his conduct was incompatible with a career as a nurse.</p>
<p>The University did not breach its procedures in conducting the Fitness to Practise Panel or the Appeal because:</p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>it had concerns about his suitability to remain on the programme so it was appropriate to use the fitness to practise procedures;</li>
<li>the concerns about S's behaviour were considered sufficiently serious to justify taking the case straight to the formal stage and this was not unreasonable;</li>
<li>there were four panel members which constitutes a valid panel under the University regulations</li>
<li>in accordance with the regulations, the Chair requested evidence and S had the opportunity to present his case;</li>
<li>S was notified of the outcome of the hearings.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Observations</span></p>
<p>S complained that the decision of the Fitness to Practise Panel was too severe. In the circumstances of this case, the decision of the Fitness to Practise Panel was a matter of professional judgment with which the OIA cannot interfere. In deciding this the OIA took into account the judgment of Mr Justice Stanley Burnton in the case of Matthew Highham v The University of Plymouth [2005] EWHC 1492 (Admin), in particular the following:</p>
<p>"In deciding whether the decision should be set aside, the Court, which is less qualified to make the decision under challenge than the decision maker, must approach that decision fairly made by those qualified to make it with the respect and deference due in such circumstances."</p>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was studying for the award of PhD.</p>
<p>S submitted his thesis for examination  and the examiners carried out  a preliminary report prior to the viva.</p>
<p>The examiners decided that the thesis was  not of PhD standard and S  was awarded an MPhil, subject to minor  amendments being completed.</p>
<p>S lodged an academic appeal against the  decision which was heard  before an Appeals Panel.  S said that there had  been a procedural error  in the conduct of the examination.  S said that  his supervisor had  incorrectly advised him to submit his thesis for  examination, even  though S considered it was not ready for submission.  S  also said that  his supervisor informed him that, if the examiners  considered the  thesis was not of an acceptable standard, they would make   recommendations and he would be given the opportunity to resubmit the   thesis at a later stage.  S also stated that he had not been informed of   the reasons why his thesis did not meet the criteria for a PhD award.   S  believed that his PhD thesis had been judged against a different set  of  criteria than that set out in the University’s Regulations.</p>
<p>S attended the appeal hearing.  The  Appeal Panel rejected the appeal  on the grounds that S had failed to  establish the grounds of appeal.</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA that:</p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>He did not receive feedback from the  examiners following the  failure of his PhD.M</li>
<li>He was given incorrect advice regarding  the submission of his  thesis by his supervisor.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /> <span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>The OIA found the complaint to be Not  Justified.</p>
<p>The OIA found that there was no breach of  the assessment regulations  in the marking of the S’s thesis.  The OIA  found that S was, in fact,  challenging the academic judgment of the  examiners and the OIA was  unable to interfere with the University’s  academic judgment.  The OIA  was satisfied from the documents provided  that the examiners had  identified significant failings in the thesis.   The OIA noted that it  was the academic judgment of the examiners that  the thesis could not  meet the standard of PhD even if further work were  completed.  The OIA  found that this decision was open to the examiners  under the  University’s assessment regulations.</p>
<p>The OIA was satisfied that it was the  student’s responsibility to  decide when his thesis was ready for  submission as set out in the  Research Handbook.</p>
<p>The OIA noted that students were clearly  informed by the University  of all possible outcomes in the examination  process.  The OIA  considered that, in deciding when to submit their  thesis for  examination, all students must weigh up the likelihood that  they may  not reach the required PhD standard and consider the  implications of  all possible results which may be awarded.</p>
<p>The OIA found that the Appeal was  conducted in accordance with the  University’s procedures and the  decision to reject the appeal was  reasonable in the circumstances.</p></div>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was studying  medicine at the University. He was born in the UK  in   1989 and, in 1996, his family moved to the USA due to his mother’s   employment.  His mother had continued to work in the USA on temporary   annual contracts  since that point. S then returned to the UK in 2007 to   continue his studies.</p>
<p>Prior to registering  as a student, S was  classed as an  international student and was charged  international fees  on that  basis. Following his registration at the University,  S  submitted a  number of appeals to the University against his  classification as  an  international student.</p>
<p>S stated that as he  was now settled in  the UK  following his 18th  birthday and that as the only citizenship he  held  was British, he  intended to settle permanently in the UK. S stated   that he had not  lived in the UK  for three years prior to his  registration as a  student, but he had come to the UK with a one way  ticket and therefore  he was  now permanently and ordinarily settled in  the UK. S asked that  he be charged home  fees.</p>
<p>The University  rejected the appeal and  maintained that as S had not  been ordinarily resident  in the UK  in the  last three years, it was  right to charge him international student  fees.</p>
<p>S complained to the  OIA that the  University was incorrect to charge  him international student fees  and  he was entitled to be charged home  fees in line with the University’s   regulations.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The OIA found the  complaint to be Not  Justified as the  OIA found  that, in order for S to be charged home  fees, he needed to  demonstrate  that his time abroad had been temporary  due to his parents’   employment abroad.  If he proved this he  would be  considered to be an  ‘excepted student’ and would only have to pay home   fees.</p>
<p>The OIA found that  the DfES guidance  provided a check list for  absence due to employment to assist  assessors  in reaching a decision  on cases where British students had not been  in  resident in the UK   for three years. The OIA noted that this guidance  advises universities  that  consideration should be given to whether the  employment contract  of the parent  was the first overseas posting of its  type or whether it  was a continuation of  similar contracts. It stated  that a succession  of similar temporary contracts  could be construed as  permanent  employment</p>
<p>The OIA was satisfied  that the  University was able to consider S’s  mother’s succession of temporary   contracts as an indictor that she was  permanently employed abroad and  found  that the decision to charge S  international student fees was  reasonable in all  the circumstances.</p></div>

    <br /><p>S was a part-time  student studying for an award of PhD.</p>
<p>S’s first supervisor,  Professor A, left  the University two years  into S’s research and her second  supervisor,  Professor B, became the  lead supervisor.  S was not allocated a new  second supervisor.  Four  years later, the University carried out  an  audit of all research  students and S was asked to attend a progress  meeting  with the  Research Degree Committee (“RDC”) to discuss her  apparent lack of   progress.  At the meeting, S was advised  that she was  to be withdrawn  from the course because she had not submitted any   progress or annual  reports during her time on the course as required  under the   University’s regulations.</p>
<p>S appealed to the  Vice Chancellor  against the decision of the RDC  on the basis of various  mitigating  circumstances including failure by  the University to provide   appropriate resources and ill health and  family problems, all of which  impeded  her progress.  S also stated  that she had  submitted her annual  reports when the University provided  them to her to  complete and that  she had not had any supervision for  four years.</p>
<p>The Vice Chancellor  rejected S’s appeal.</p>
<p>S complained to the  OIA that:</p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>Her annual reports had been submitted  except that for the current  year.</li>
<li>S had not been warned of the time  limits or given a deadline in  which to submit the 10 month progress  report prior       to being  withdrawn.</li>
<li>The University had not provided S with  a new second supervisor and  Professor B had been unavailable for        supervision.</li>
<li>S was not provided with the necessary  resources to undertake her  studies, even though she made the University        aware of her  problems.</li>
<li>The University failed to take into  account of her mitigating  circumstances.</li>
<li>S had not been warned prior to the  progress meeting that she was to  be withdrawn and she considered that  the       outcome of the meeting  had been predetermined.</li>
<li>The minutes of the  progress meeting  were not an accurate  reflection of the meeting.</li>
<li>There was also a  delay in sending a  copy of the minutes to her.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The OIA found the complaint  to be Partly  Justified.</p>
<p>The OIA was highly  critical of the  University’s failure to ensure  adequate supervisory  arrangements were  in place for S when Professor A  left.  Whilst the OIA accepted that the  supervisory  relationship was  of a two way nature and it was satisfied  that S should have  contacted  Professor B after Professor A had left the  University, in the OIA’s   view the primary responsibility for  perceiving and acting on a problem  lay with  Professor B.  When  Professor A left the  University that  role, as the University accepted,  should have been assumed by   Professor B.</p>
<p>The OIA noted that  the University failed  to provide any  clarification of the roles and  responsibilities of the  student /  supervisor relationship.  The OIA also noted that there  appeared to   have been no supervisory framework as recommended in the  QAA Code of   Practice.</p>
<p>The OIA concluded  that S appeared not to  have received any  supervision from Professor B nor was  she reminded by  him of the  milestones that she was expected to meet in order to   progress on the  course.  The OIA noted  that the University admitted in  its internal  document that Professor B had  never supervised the  student.  The OIA   was critical that the University had failed to  monitor, or addressed,  S’s lack  of academic progress for four years.</p>
<p>The OIA noted that S  had not been  proactive in addressing her  supervision and her lack of academic   progress and it appeared that S  was content to continue to re-enrol on  the  course and pay fees each  year in spite of receiving no supervision  and making  no apparent  academic progress.  However,  the OIA did not  think it reasonable for  the University to continue to allow S  to  re-enrol on the course each  year in such circumstances as the  University’s  regulations made it  clear that at least once a year, the  RDC needed to  establish whether a  candidate was actively engaged on the  research programme  and was  maintaining regular and frequent contact  with supervisors.   The RDC  was also required to consider  reports from  the supervisors on the  candidate’s progress and take appropriate   action.  This had not  happened in S’s  case.</p>
<p>The OIA was not  satisfied that the  letter sent to S prior to the  progress meeting notified her  that she  might be withdrawn.  The OIA   considered that given the seriousness of  the potential outcome, S  should have  been made explicitly aware of the  possible outcome of the  meeting.</p>
<p>The OIA was also  critical of the  apparent lack of any written  procedure governing the process by  which  the University may withdraw a  postgraduate student due to lack of   academic progress.</p>
<p>The OIA upheld S’s  complaint that the  University did not provide  the minutes of the progress  meeting in a  timely manner which made it  difficult for S to formulate her  appeal.</p>
<p>The OIA noted that  the University did  not have a mitigating  circumstance procedure for  postgraduate research  students.  However,   the OIA found that the University was entitled to  find that the  circumstances  which S raised in her appeal did not  adequately explain  her lack of progress on  the course.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>The University put in place mechanisms   to ensure that where a  change in the supervisory team is required, the  student is notified in  writing of the fact and of the steps taken by  the University to  facilitate the change.</li>
<li>The University review its procedures  for monitoring the progress of  research degree students on at least an  annual basis.</li>
<li>The University review its mechanisms  for providing feedback on a  student’s lack of academic progress and to  ensure that all staff  receive training to ensure that they are aware of  their roles in that  process.  As part of the review, the University  should consider  providing clear written guidance in the Handbook and  Regulations as to  the process to be followed  in the event that it  becomes necessary to  withdraw a student through the lack of academic  progress.</li>
<li>The University to  offer to pay S the sum of £800 for compensation   for the failings  highlighted.  In deciding this amount,  the OIA took   into account the fact that S was not sufficiently proactive in  raising   and resolving these issues.</li>
</ul>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was an  international student registered on a postgraduate research   course.<br /> <br /> Before being accepted  onto the Course, the  University interviewed  and obtained references on S.  It ascertained  that her International  English  Language Testing System (“IELTS”) score  was poor and that her  results from her  previous master’s course were  low passes.   As a  condition of being accepted on to the University’s  programme, S was   required to attend English classes.  S  attended some  English classes,  but gave them up, informing her supervisor of  this.</p>
<p>Although there were  difficulties in arranging mutually  convenient  tutorials, eight sessions were  held and the Annual Review  indicated  that good progress had been made and that  there was a  satisfactory  student-supervisor relationship.  However, S’s application  to transfer  to PhD  study was not approved because of poor research  design  compounded by the use of  poor English.</p>
<p>S complained to the  head of the PhD programme about the decision  of  the Transfer Panel and her supervision.  A meeting was held with the   head of the PhD  programme and her supervisor to determine the way   forward.  After several further supervision sessions, a  revised   transfer application was submitted.   The supervisor initially responded   that he could not provide any  feedback because of the poor English.     After several resubmissions, he provided detailed written feedback.   The  second Transfer Panel approved the  revised application and S   progressed to PhD study.</p>
<p>S submitted an  outline of her research which related to a  different  topic to that agreed by  the Transfer Panel.  The supervisor    requested further information on the new proposal.  S was in her home   country at that stage and,  after being chased by the supervisor,   appeared confused as to what was required  of her.</p>
<p>S refused to sign the  subsequent annual review form and met with   the Head of PhD Studies and  requested a different supervisor.  The    University agreed to this.</p>
<p>Several months later,  it became apparent there were difficulties   between the new supervisor and  S.  S requested a more “sympathetic”    supervisor.  S attended meetings with the  Head of the PhD Studies and   the new supervisor to discuss the supervision  arrangements and the work   required of her.   In the second of the meetings, S appeared  distressed  and was referred to  the Student Health Centre.  S  complained  about  the meeting.</p>
<p>S attended a further  meeting with the head of the PhD Studies,  the  new supervisor and the Dean of  Faculty to discuss her lack of  progress  and the continuation of her  registration.  S was informed that  she   appeared to have unrealistic expectations of the role of her  supervisor  and was  offered the option of changing to study for an MPhil  which  she appeared to  accept.  S submitted a draft MPhil thesis  to  the head  of PhD study.</p>
<p>S subsequently made a  formal complaint about inadequate  supervision  and the decision to transfer her  to an MPhil programme.   The  complaint was  not upheld.  S submitted a further complaint  but  this  was also rejected.</p>
<p>S requested that the  OIA reviewed:</p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>The supervision she received.</li>
<li>The University’s investigation of her complaint.</li>
<li>The decision to  transfer her to an MPhil programme.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The OIA found the  complaint to be Partly Justified.</p>
<p>The OIA found that  the University admitted S onto the PhD  programme  knowing of her low marks in  her master’s course and that she  had a  poor IELTS test score. Whilst the OIA  could not comment on the   University’s decision to accept her on the course, the  OIA found that   the University should have been on notice that S required more  support   than other students in the circumstances.</p>
<p>The OIA considered  that much of S’s complaint arose from her not   fully understanding the nature of  independent study at PhD level and   having an incorrect view of what was  required of her and her   supervisors.  The  OIA considered that this was not addressed at the   outset of her research as  required by the Regulations.</p>
<p>The OIA found that  the decision to transfer S to an MPhil  programme  was one of academic judgment  and it fell outside the scope of  the  OIA’s review.  <br /> The OIA noted that  the University had already  waived £8,000 of  S’s fees.</p></div>

  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S  was registered on part time taught MA course. Students were   required to pass a  core research skills module and two option modules   in stage 1 and a  dissertation in stage 2 to complete the MA.</p>
<p>S  selected two option modules taught by Dr A. Four months into S’s   studies Dr A  left the University's employment but continued to be   responsible for supporting  students on these modules, offering remote   support by email.</p>
<p>Owing  to illness S requested an extension, which was granted, to   complete her  assessed work for these modules.  S also  drew attention   to Dr A's absence. S submitted her assessments by the new  deadline.</p>
<p>The  Exam Board noted that S had failed stage 1 of the course and it   thought that  she had withdrawn.  The Exam Board  therefore did not   arrange for her to take any reassessments.</p>
<p>S  submitted an Appeal against the decision of the Exam Board. She   stated that she  had received no lectures in writing and research skills   at Masters level which  she felt was needed to  adjust to   postgraduate  writing and she complained about Dr A’s absence and a lack  of  support.</p>
<p>The  University rejected S's Appeal on the grounds that the Exam   Board had been  aware of all the matters raised by S at the time it made   its decision.  It said that after Dr A had left, S had been  able to   contact Dr A and that Professor B had been available for additional    support.  The University stated that  Professor B said that S had only   had minimal contact with him.  The University noted that the Chair of   the  Exam Board said that a student studying at this level should   already have a  good standard of essay writing and that further guidance   was available in the  handbook.  The University took her ill  health   into consideration when making its decision.  It also said that S’s   complaint was a result  of a mismatch of her expectations of the   programme and the Department’s  expectations of the students.  The    University suggested that Masters level study was characterized by   independent  study and research rather than direct teaching.   It went   on to say that, as S had a good degree, it was not unreasonable  for her   to have made the transition to master’s level smoothly.</p>
<p>S  complained to the OIA about her appeal. The OIA suspended   consideration of S's  application because the University was   investigating her complaint and there  were considerable areas of   overlap with her appeal. The University rejected S's  application to   initiate the final stage of the complaints procedure because it  was out   of time.</p>
<p>S  subsequently complained to the OIA that:</p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>The University  did not offer appropriate levels of academic   support which caused her to fail.  S contended that the University did   not provide the level of teaching outlined  in the programme handbook   and emails from Dr A were not equivalent to  face-to-face teaching. </li>
<li>The stress S suffered  as a result of this lack of support caused   her to be unwell which had financial  consequences.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The  OIA found the complaint Justified.</p>
<p>The  University did not consider whether S's concerns were based on a   legitimate  expectation that she would receive face-to-face teaching  in  order to develop  the skills and knowledge required by the course.  The  University consideration  of the complaint was insufficiently   investigated as the Department did not  present any evidence that S had   been supported in the manner promised by the  prospectus. The OIA found   that the course prospectus and handbook, and other  published material   stressed the importance of personal tutorial contact and the    acquisition and development of skills at master's level through regular   meetings  and tutor-led learning.</p>
<p>The  OIA was critical of the University's management of the tutor’s   departure as  there was no discussion with individual students as to the   impact of Dr A’s  departure. No alternative support was put in place   until students expressed  dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>The  Exam Board’s decision in regard to S’s progression was based on a   flawed  assumption that she had withdrawn. A lack of transparency in   the appeals  procedure meant S was not given a copy of the papers so was   unaware the Board  had made this assumption and was unable to  challenge  it.</p>
<p>The University was  unhelpful in the manner in which it communicated   information about the final  stage of its complaints procedure as its   letter did not say it was possible to  appeal against the formal   decision letter or provide any time limits for doing  so. Its decision   to reject C’s complaint as out of time was unreasonable.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations</span></p>
<p>As  S had obtained a lesser award of PG Diploma, the OIA did not   consider it  appropriate to recommend her fees be refunded in full. It   recommended that the  University:</p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>Should offer to pay  £900 in compensation for its failure to   provide academic support as described  in the course prospectus and   handbook.</li>
<li>Should consider the  effect of this failure properly within its   appeal and complaints procedures.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Observations</span></p>
<p>The OIA was critical  of the fact that the University did not provide   S with copies of reports  prepared by the Department in response to  her  appeal prior to the appeal panel  hearing.  The OIA considers that   universities  have a duty to act fairly and is required to ensure that   all parties to a  dispute should have the opportunity to see and  comment  on material relied on by  the decision maker.  The OIA strongly    suggested that the University reviewed its procedures in relation to   this.</p></div>

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was registered on  an  MA by research course, which  included the submission of a thesis.</p>
<p>The supervisor said  that only stylistic changes needed to be made to   S’s thesis. The supervisor  believed there were issues with S’s level   of English but did not advise her to  undertake further classes to   address this issue.  When S asked whether the thesis was of a  standard   to submit, the supervisor hesitated and suggested they consult with    another person.   The supervisor arranged  for a retired colleague to   review the thesis.   The colleague’s comments were more critical than   the supervisor’s.  S made the amendments and the supervisor  again gave   positive feedback to S.</p>
<p>S was subsequently  referred in her thesis.  S complained to  the   Director of Research Development that she had received inadequate    supervision and of delays.  The Director  responded that delays had   occurred due to emails being sent to another staff  member with the same   name as her tutor and also reported that the examiners had  indicated   that the thesis should be referred for further work before an oral    examination could take place.</p>
<p>S escalated her  complaint about inadequate supervision to the Head   of the Department.  S said that she had had positive comments  from her   supervisor on the thesis and was disappointed to learn that the thesis    required profound reworking and restructuring.   S asked for   compensation in the form of a transfer to another university  for which   the University would pay the transfer fee.</p>
<p>The Head of the  Department rejected the complaint.  He  believed   that S received more supervision than other students and that her    supervisor had raised issues similar to those raised by the examiners.</p>
<p>S escalated her complaint.  A reply was due within ten working days.    Four months later, the University replied  rejecting the complaint.   It  emphasised  that the responsibility for the academic nature of the   research and the final  thesis submission lay with the student.</p>
<p>S complained to the  OIA that she had been unfairly treated by the   University.  S said that the supervision was so poor she  did not wish   to stay at the University after her thesis had been referred.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons</span></p>
<p>The OIA found the  complaint to be Justified.</p>
<p>The OIA found that  the University was unable to provide any record   of supervision of S’s research  or minutes of meetings which took place   to discuss S’s dissatisfaction with the  supervision.  The supervisor   had not  completed any successful supervisions of PhD at the time of S’s    supervision.  S had not been given any  Personal Development  Portfolio  as required by the Regulations.  S had not been interviewed  before  being  accepted onto the course nor did the Department require  her to  attend the  Induction Day as stipulated in the Regulations.   S  was not  required to undergo an annual review or offered targeted   training as  set out in the Regulations.</p>
<p>The OIA’s review  showed that the supervisor had many other   commitments, suffered serious health  issues and was not always   available to respond to S’s questions.</p>
<p>In light of the  general tone of the email correspondence, the lack   of the primary documentation  which should have recorded the key stages   of the research degree process, the  OIA found that the University   failed to demonstrate that it complied with the  normal professional   levels of supervision and guidance routinely anticipated by  students to   ensure satisfactory progress in a research degree.</p>
<p>In referring to his  retired colleague rather than following the   supervision procedures, the OIA  considered that the supervisor showed a   lack of confidence in his own skills to  monitor the work and to offer   the kind of constructive criticism that was  required.</p>
<p>The OIA was not  satisfied that the University adequately addressed   S’s concerns regarding her  supervision.</p>
<p>The OIA found that  there were delays in the University’s handling of   S’s complaints and in  responding to the OIA’s requests for   information.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations</span></p>

  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S had been unsuccessful in her second  year medical exams at the first and  second attempt. Under the  University's regulations, students are automatically  considered by a  Discretionary Panel with the power to award a discretionary  third  attempt. S submitted a statement to the panel detailing some family   events which she felt had affected her performance. The panel did not  award S a  third attempt, and she submitted an appeal in which she  provided further  information about the family events. S's appeal was  rejected, and she  complained to the OIA on the grounds that the Appeal  Panel had not considered  her case fully. She felt that the appeal panel  had not acknowledged the new  evidence she had submitted about the  family events.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>The OIA found the University's decision  not to exercise its discretion to allow  a further attempt to be  reasonable.

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was registered on a course during which one of the module convenors   informed the class that one of the examinations would be marked using a   "negative marking" system for the multiple choice section. When the   class came to sit the examination, there was no mention of a negative  marking  system on the examination paper. Some students queried this,  and the matter was  clarified. However, S was not one of these students.  Following the examination,  the University decided to mark the  examination using both a positive and a  negative marking system, giving  students the most favourable mark, to ensure  none of the students were  disadvantaged. S appealed on the basis of a procedural  irregularity  and undisclosed mitigating circumstances.</p>
<p>The University decided that appropriate steps  had been taken to mitigate the  ambiguous examination directions and  that the mitigating circumstances had not  been disclosed in accordance  with the relevant procedures.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>The OIA found that the University's decision  to reject the appeal was not  unreasonable: the affected section formed a  small part of the examination; S  had the opportunity to request  clarification, but did not to do so, and S did not  offer evidence in  support of her claim for mitigating circumstances, nor a  reason why  they could not have been disclosed in accordance with the relevant   procedures at the correct time.</p></div>

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S enrolled at the University in 2002. In 2003 the University  confirmed her  registration for the degree of MPhil with the possibility  of transfer to PhD,  with a period of registration of at least 54  months from May 2003. She was  informed that if she wished to transfer  to PhD the earliest date she could do  so was November 2004. S made it  clear to her supervisors that she wished to  complete her PhD early, and  changed from full-time to part-time employment to  accommodate this.  Her transfer from MPhil to PhD was approved in November 2004.  In  December 2005, with the support of her supervisors, she applied to  submit  her PhD earlier than the recommended submission date and this  was approved by  the University. In January S submitted her PhD and  returned to full-time  employment.</p>
<p>In February 2006 S had a mock viva, and a  date in March 2006 was set for the  examination of her thesis. However,  shortly before the viva was due to take  place it was postponed and the  thesis was referred for further work, following  a provisional  recommendation from the two external examiners.</p>
<p>In May 2006 S submitted a complaint to  the University about the cancellation  of the viva and the supervision  she had received. She contended that her  supervisors should have told  her she had not spent enough time on her thesis  and advised her not to  submit it. She claimed out-of-pocket expenses and loss  of earnings for  the period of her studies of over £50,000. The complaint  progressed  through a number of stages and the University sent S its final  decision  in September 2007. It said that the advisory team should have advised  S  more forcefully on the time-frame for submission, and would have been  best  advised not to have supported the early submission. However, it  found no  grounds for financial reimbursement and considered that the  University had  fulfilled its obligations to S.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>The OIA found that the supervisory team  should have been more robust in the  face of S's determination to submit  her thesis early, in considering whether to  support her application  for approval for early submission. The OIA also found  that there were  delays in the University's consideration of S's complaint.  However, the  OIA did not consider that the University was unreasonable in not   compensating her for loss of earnings, as the regulations made it clear  that a  supervisor's agreement to submission did not guarantee the award  of a degree.  It still remained open to S to proceed with the PhD.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>£500 compensation in recognition of  the expense S incurred in submitting her thesis, the distress she  experienced due to the cancellation of her viva and the delay in dealing  with her complaint. </li>

  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S joined the course hoping to go on a student exchange. He achieved  46% in  a module and was advised that he was not eligible to go on the  exchange. He  lodged a complaint which was rejected by the University.</p>
<p>He complained to the OIA that the University  had not accurately described  its exchange programme. The programme was  highly regulated and it had not been  advertised that participation on  the exchange was subject to terms and  conditions. He stated that the  University had breached the Unfair Trading Act  2008 as the advertising  was misleading and hid information. He only found out  about the rules  (terms and conditions) after he had started the course.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>The OIA found that the University had not  deliberately misrepresented the  course. However, the University's  publicity literature was unclear as to who  would be able to qualify for  the exchange and did not advise students that they  would need to apply  and meet certain academic requirements in order to be  eligible. It was  evident that requirements for participation on the exchange  were in  place prior to S beginning the course. In order to make decisions   regarding the course students should have timely access to the  University's  rules and regulations and in this case S did not have this  information to  inform his choices.</p>
<p>The OIA could not recommend that S be given a  place on the exchange  programme. There was evidence to show that S's  application was considered and  that he was interviewed as part of the  process while his appeal was pending.</p>
<p>Ultimately S did not meet the academic  requirements to be eligible for the  exchange. However, the University  should amend certain publicity material to  make the requirements clear  to students. Students should also be given this  information as soon as  possible to ensure they can make informed decisions  about the course.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>The University should take measures  to  ensure that amendments to the Progression and Assessment Regulations   are confirmed and published in time for students to receive this  information when they register on the course or shortly thereafter. </li>
<li>The University should amend its  promotional material and the website by adding a statement which alerts  students to the fact that they are not automatically eligible for a  place on the exchange programme, and may not get a place at their first  choice institution. </li>
<li>The University should offer to pay to S  the sum of £750 as a result of the fact that   the University failed to  provide him with important course information in a timely manner and for  the disappointment that he experienced as a result of the unclear  publicity literature. </li>

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S appealed against marks awarded for three units in Year 2, on the  grounds  that the University did not implement her student support plan  until Year 3 and  thus failed to make reasonable adjustments for her  disability. S had declared a  disability in relation to a serious mental  illness and cognitive difficulties  linked to dyslexia at the outset of  her course. Because of the complexity of  S's condition it took a  considerable time for an effective support plan to be  developed. In  Year 3, after a revised support plan had been put in place, S's   performance improved, and professional staff involved confirmed that the   revised plan had contributed to this improvement. The University  rejected S's  appeal on the grounds that it had acted reasonably in  applying adjustments in  Year 3 and could make no retrospective  allowance for earlier work.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>The OIA found that the delay in achieving an  optimal support plan resulted from  the complexity of S's condition,  rather than from any failure on the part of  the University or S. The  OIA found, however, that the University had acted  unreasonably in  dismissing her appeal without considering retrospectively the  effects  of her disability in the light of further information which emerged   about the effectiveness of various adjustments.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>The OIA recommended that the  University  should review S's appeal, giving due consideration to whether it was  possible to make allowances for any possible substantial disadvantage  arising from limitations in the support provided at the time of the  assessments concerned. </li>
<li>The OIA made no recommendation about the  outcome of the review, which was properly a matter of academic judgment. </li>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was an undergraduate student who suffered from a severe skin  condition.  Most of the time, S was able to manage his condition;  however, occasionally he  would experience chronic and debilitating  "flare-ups". During the  first year of his course, S applied for and was  granted special examination  arrangements which enabled him to sit and  pass his first and second year  examinations successfully. However, in  the days leading up to and during his final  examinations, S experienced  a chronic flare-up of his condition. He submitted a  special  circumstances form to the University claiming that the effect of the   flare-up was so severe that the examination arrangements were  insufficient to  address the effects of his condition. With his form, S  submitted detailed  medical evidence which supported his claim. The  University rejected S's special  circumstances claim, and subsequent  appeal, on the basis that special  examination arrangements were in  place and to accept his special circumstances  claim would amount to  "double counting".</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA that the  University failed to take proper account of  his special circumstances  when considering his final degree classification. In  particular, he  contended that the University did not take account of the fact  that the  alternative arrangements which were in place for his examinations   (five minute rest breaks per hour) were not adequate during his final   examinations. The remedy he sought was for the OIA to recommend that the   University reconsider his final degree result.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>There was evidence that the Board of  Examiners may not have asked itself the  right questions and/or may have  unduly fettered its discretion when considering S's final year special  circumstances claim. In particular, the OIA found that  the Board of  Examiners had failed to consider whether the special facilities  and  extra allowances provided for the student during his final year   examinations were an adequate and balancing compensation for his  condition.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>The University to refer S's appeal   back to the Examination Board for reconsideration. </li>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was a first year student from Sweden, studying Bio-Chemistry, who   received details of a Scholarship scheme after she arrived at the  University. A  mark equivalent to AAB at A level was required for an  award. S had matriculated  with the Swedish Slutbetyg and had achieved a  mark of VG overall. S submitted  an application for the Scholarship  which the University rejected. S referred  the case to the OIA, on the  basis that she believed that the University did not  understand how her  qualification should be calculated against A Levels. S' mark  of VG was  shown as being equivalent to a range of marks from BBC to AAB while  she  believed it was always equivalent to the higher end of the scale.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>There is no direct equivalence between  Swedish qualifications and United Kingdom  qualifications. The OIA found  that the University used its academic judgment,  based on the expert  advice of NARIC (the National Agency responsible for  providing  information and advice about vocational, academic and professional  skills and qualifications from all over the world), to calculate a band  of  equivalences suitable for admissions and for the award of  scholarships. This  included considering S' scores in separate subjects,  relevant to her degree, as  well as the overall score.</p></div>

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was a first year student who became friends with another student,  R, on  commencing his course and accompanied his friend in a series of  violent  incidents at the University which included the sexual  harassment of female  students. Both students were taken through the  University disciplinary  procedure and admitted the incidents although S  blamed R for initiating the  behaviour. Both students were expelled  from the University. S appealed to the  University, he said that as he  was only an accomplice he should have received a  lesser punishment than  R.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>The penalty was within the discretionary  range available to the University and  the decision to expel was  reasonable in all the circumstances.</p></div>

  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was an overseas student on a Geology masters. He failed some  modules and  then had to take a temporary withdrawal. The University  offered a resit  opportunity outside the normal assessment period in  order to assist the student  who was in danger of losing his visa. Three  open-book examinations were set,  which S failed. S had also failed  another assessment and so was withdrawn from  the degree due to having  failed four modules at the final attempt. S had  undisclosed mental  health problems which he revealed after his failure. He  appealed on the  basis that he believed something sinister had occurred, as he  did not  believe that it was possible to fail an open book assessment. S   appealed against the University's decision and asked for the return of  his fees  in order to take the degree at another institution.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>The University had correctly followed the  assessment and appeal regulations.  The University had also reacted in a  flexible manner to S's pastoral problems  and requests.</p></div>

  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>The University made S an unconditional offer of a place through  clearing  following a telephone conversation with the Admissions Tutor  during which S  declared his A Level results. S enrolled on the course  and after a lengthy  delay produced his A Level certificates; they did  not reflect the results he  had declared in the telephone conversation.  The University wrote to S  withdrawing him from the course. S responded  by threatening legal action  against the University. He continued to  attend lectures and hand in coursework  until the University refused to  allow him to take his exams in the summer term.  S complained that the  University was in breach of contract by removing him form  the course.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>The OIA found that S had provided  contradictory and wrong information to the  University about his A Level  results. The offer of the place was made on the  basis of the results  which S had declared. The University was entitled to  rescind that offer  when the true results were ascertained.</p></div>

    <a href="#" class="accordianTitle2">Case Study 8<span class="accordianTitle3"><br />Issues: MPhil/PhD, progression, mitigation<br />Outcome: <strong>Partly Justified</strong></span></a>
  </p>
  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was registered for an MPhil leading to a PhD, paying substantial  fees.  The university soon had serious concerns about S's work but said  nothing to  her. In due course, her progress was reviewed to see whether  it was appropriate  to transfer her registration to PhD level. The  university concluded that she  had not got to grips sufficiently with  her research to have a good prospect of  reaching doctoral standard. S  was adamant that her work was fine.</p>
<p>When S complained, the university offered  her the chance of submitting a  document to show how she would deal  with the concerns that had been expressed  about her work. If she had  produced a convincing document, the university would  have reconsidered  its decision not to allow her to progress to PhD level. S did  not take  up this opportunity but instead complained to the OIA.</p>
<p>S made some other complaints that were  not found to be valid.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>S had not been warned at an earlier stage  that her standard of work was well  below PhD level. She had therefore  been deprived of the opportunity of  reconsidering her position and  cutting her losses. For this reason the OIA held  that her complaint was  partly justified. However, in determining the  appropriate amount of  compensation, the OIA took into account the likelihood  that S would  have been determined to continue and also her failure to mitigate  her  position by taking up the university's reasonable offer.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>£1,000 compensation </li>

  <div>
    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was a first year student at the University who had a multiple  personality  disorder. She lived in University-owned accommodation with  nine other students.  Late one evening a "food fight" took place at the  house which  resulted in substantial damage to the house and property of  some of the  residents. S and another student admitted they had been  involved in the  incident. The other students present denied any  involvement.</p>
<p>A disciplinary hearing was convened and  the Disciplinary Panel recommended  that S:</p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>be evicted from University  accommodation, </li>
<li>give an undertaking as to future good  conduct; </li>
<li>pay half the cost of the damage to  University accommodation and compensate the other residents for the food  they had lost. </li>
</ul>
<p>S appealed against the Disciplinary  Panel's decision. Whilst S's substantive  appeal was dismissed the  Appeal Panel allowed her to remain in University  accommodation.</p>
<p>S complained to the OIA that her actions  resulted from the effects of her  medication and disability and  therefore the decision to initiate disciplinary  proceedings was  discriminatory. S also complained that she had not had the  opportunity  to comment on the costs of the reparation work before it was   undertaken.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>There was no causal relationship between  the student's medical condition/disability  and her actions in causing  damage to University property. The University was  acting reasonably and  in accordance with its procedures in taking disciplinary  action  against her.</p>
<p>However, the University ought to have  obtained a breakdown of the estimated  costs of reparation work and that  breakdown ought to have been disclosed to the student for comment.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>the University should offer to reduce  S's contribution to the reparation costs by £100. </li>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>Mr A wished to enrol on an MSc course and accepted an offer of a  place on  the MSc on the basis that he first took a preliminary stage.  That stage  required him to pass the first three units at the first  attempt before he could  progress to the rest of the course. He failed  one of the first three units and  sought advice as to whether he could  write off his first attempt and get back  on track for the MSc.</p>
<p>He was then wrongly advised that he  could retake the failed unit at a later  date. He subsequently paid for  and took further units. He was advised a year  later that he could not  obtain the MSc because he had failed his first attempt  at one of the  first three units.</p>
<p>He complained informally to his  department but he received no response,  despite chasing the matter up  for 8 months.  Four months further on, he  submitted a formal complaint  to the University.</p>
<p>The University accepted that it had  failed to address his informal complaint  and offered him a chance to  progress on the course. However, Mr A and the  University could not  reach agreement over the timetable of the course.</p>
<p>Mr A complained to the OIA that the  implications of the preliminary stage  had not been explained to him,  that incorrect advice had led him to pay for  further units  unnecessarily and that the University had inadequately dealt with  his  complaint.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>Mr A was adequately advised about the  preliminary stage, but given wrong advice  which led to him purchasing  the further units and his complaint was not dealt  with properly.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>Compensation of £3750, including  an amount to account for the units Mr A had paid for unnecessarily on  the basis of the University's inaccurate advice.</li>
<li>The University to review staff   training in relation to its complaints procedures. </li>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>Mrs S was awarded a degree with Lower Second Class Honours. In August  2006  she submitted an appeal saying that she was unhappy with the  degree  classification which the University rejected two months later. S  submitted  another appeal raising new issues in relation to tutorial  support and the  treatment of certain students.</p>
<p>The University rejected the appeal but did  not address the issue of tutorial  support. Mrs S submitted a further  appeal challenging the University's decision  and saying that the issue  of tutorial support had not been addressed. The  University rejected the  appeal but again failed to address the issue of tutorial  support. Mrs S  submitted a formal complaint to the University about the way  that it  had handled her appeal. The University appeared to lose its file and   did not respond. Mrs S raised her complaint again and also raised  further  issues which had not been included in her appeal.</p>
<p>The University apologised for the delay in  addressing the complaint and then  gave reasons as to why her appeal had  not previously been upheld (again not  addressing the issue of tutorial  support).</p>
<p>Mrs S complained to the OIA about the  handling of her appeal and complaint  and the University's failure to  address the new issues raised by her in August  2007.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>It was inappropriate for the University to  investigate the further issues  raised in August 2007 when considering a  complaint about the way it had handled  an appeal. However, the  University did not fully address the appeal and failed  to  satisfactorily investigate the subsequent complaint in a timely and  thorough  manner.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>Compensation of £400. </li>
<li>The University to reviews its appeals and  complaints procedures. </li>
<li>The University to ensure that its staff  are appropriately trained on the appeals and complaints procedures. </li>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was in her third year and returned to the University's halls of  residence  to take her finals and complete her dissertation. The  University had not  informed her that major building works would be  taking place around her  accommodation. This work was very noisy and  took place many hours of each day  and seven days a week. S complained  to the University throughout the academic  year that it was disrupting  her academic work. The University eventually moved  the student to a  quieter accommodation block in the last term. S appealed to  the  University when her marks were only 0.5% below the 2.1 threshold. The   University said that it would have considered it as a mitigating  circumstances  claim had the student made a formal application earlier  but that it was not  willing to accept an appeal based on mitigating  circumstances at this stage.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>S' clear communications to the University  should have been accepted as a  mitigating circumstances application or  she should have been advised to submit  a formal application.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>That the case be referred back to the  Examination Board to consider the mitigating circumstances. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>The University accepted the OIA's  recommendation and S' degree  classification was reconsidered in the  light of the mitigating circumstances.  She was subsequently awarded a  2.1.</em></p></div>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was on a 3 year degree course with a second year abroad on a  University  organised exchange scheme. The University threatened to  de-register S while he  was abroad as it had recorded S' status  incorrectly at the Academic Registry. S  contacted the University and  attempted to update his record. Unfortunately, due  to the University's  mistakes he could not enrol on the third year modules in  which he  wished to specialise nor on the dissertation for which he had already   commenced his research. S complained to the University throughout the  final  academic year and in particular after he achieved a 2.1 overall  in his third  year. S' profile had indicated that he was a first class  standard at the end of  his second year. S appealed on the basis of the  disadvantages that he suffered  throughout the third year studying  subjects that he had not chosen. The  University investigated the case  and identified that there had been failings on  the part of the  University but it did not offer a remedy to S. There were  delays  throughout the University's investigations and subsequent significant   delays in the provision of documentation once the case was referred to  the OIA.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<p>The OIA found that the university had been unreasonable in the administration of the programme and in its management of the complaint. We recommended compensation of £5,000 and required the University to provide a reference for S explaining the administrative issues that may have had a detrimental effect on his final degree performance.</p></div>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was studying for a Master's degree. She was dissatisfied with the   course and left at the end of the first term. On the basis of her  experience,  she did not envisage that the next two terms would improve  and she considered  that no practicable alternatives had been offered by  the University. She  requested the return of her fees for the remaining  two terms. S considered that  the published material about the course  was misleading, and that her experience  did not reflect what had been  discussed at her interview. The University said  that S had made an  informed choice to leave the course and, as this was a  voluntary  decision, she was not entitled to a fee refund. The University   acknowledged that there were some difficulties for students on  particular  options and had subsequently made changes to the unit in  question.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>On the facts of this case the OIA found  that there were discrepancies between  S's legitimate expectations of  the course arising from the published material  and her experience of  it. The University did not appear to have considered the  core reason  for S's dissatisfaction or specifically looked at the intended and   actual learning opportunities. Had it done so it would have been  reasonable to  consider a refund of some or all of the fees.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>The OIA recommended the return of 80%  of the fees for the two terms after S had left the course. </li>

    <span class="accordianTitle4">Summary:</span>
    <br /><p>S was a third year undergraduate student. After sitting his final  exams he  returned home and was contacted by telephone and asked to  return that day to  dictate an illegible examination script. When  dictating his answers S improved  and added to his original answers.  This was discovered and a disciplinary  hearing was convened. S was  awarded zero for his paper and the offence noted on  his record. However  awarding S a mark of zero did not affect his overall degree   classification and so the University also reduced his degree from a  lower  second degree to a third. S complained that he had been doubly  punished for the  same offence. He also complained that he had been  given no advice orally or  written about what he should do when asked to  dictate his script.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Reasons:</span></p>
<p>The OIA found the complaint to be  justified as the University had no written  policy about the dictation  of illegible exam scripts, there was no evidence  that S was told what  was required of him and at the hearing S's supporter was  wrongly  advised that he was unable to speak in S's defence. There was also   delay and lack of notice of meetings.</p>
<p><span class="accordianTitle4">Recommendations:</span></p>
<ul class="genericUL">
<li>That the Board of Examiners reconsider  S's case with a view to fixing a penalty that is both proportionate to  the offence and reflective of the shortcomings in its procedures. </li>
<li>That the University reconsider the   note placed on S's record that he had admitted an offence of cheating. </li>
<li>That the University pay S £100 in  recognition of the procedural irregularities that had occurred. </li>
<li>That the University introduces  regulations or guidance relating to illegible examination scripts as  soon  as possible. </li>
