# Ofsted reports

Ofsted is a regulator of schools and other establishments such as nurseries and childminders. On their site you can [search for reports](https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/). 

In this case I've searched for reports published in the last week, and filtered on provider type to show only primary schools. The results are generated at [this URL](https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/results/any/21/any/any/any/any/any/any/any/week/0/0#search4)

A typical provider URL looks like this: https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/ELS/103980

And a typical report URL looks like this: https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/2631211/urn/103980.pdf

Some reports are included in this repository to demonstrate PDF scraping techniques for educational purposes.
